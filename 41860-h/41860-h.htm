<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>OF no other author, perhaps, has more been written
than of Shakespeare. Yet whatever other knowledge
his commentators professed, few of them appear to have
been naturalists, and none, so far as I am aware, have
examined his knowledge of Ornithology.</p>

<p>An inquiry upon this subject, undertaken in the first
instance for my own amusement, has resulted in the
bringing together of so much that is curious and entertaining,
that to the long list of books already published
about Shakespeare, I have been bold enough to add yet
another. In so doing, I venture to hope that the reader
may so far appreciate the result of my labour as not to
consider it superfluous.</p>

<p>As regards the treatment of the subject, a word or two
of explanation seems necessary. In 1866, from the notes
I had then collected, I contributed a series of articles on
the birds of Shakespeare to <i>The Zoologist</i>. In these
articles, I referred only to such birds as have a claim to be
considered British, and omitted all notice of domesticated
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_viii" title="viii"> </a><!--008.png-->
species. I had not then considered any special arrangement
or grouping, but noticed each species <i>seriatim</i> in the
order adopted by Mr. Yarrell in his excellent “History of
British Birds.” Since that date, I have collected so much
additional information on the subject, that, instead of
eighty pages (the extent of my first publication), three
hundred have now passed through the printers’ hands.
With this large accession of material, it was found absolutely
necessary to re-arrange and re-write the whole. The
birds therefore have been now divided into certain natural
groups, including the foreign and domesticated species, to
each of which groups a chapter has been devoted; and I
have thought it desirable to give, by way of introduction,
a sketch of Shakespeare’s general knowledge of natural
history and acquaintance with field-sports, as bearing
more or less directly on his special knowledge of Ornithology,
which I propose chiefly to consider.</p>

<p>After I had published the last of the series of articles
referred to, I received an intimation for the first time, that,
twenty years previously, a notice of the birds of Shakespeare
had appeared in the pages of <i>The Zoologist</i>. I
lost no time in procuring the particular number which
contained the article, and found that, in December, 1846,
Mr. T.&nbsp;W. Barlow, of Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, had, to
a certain extent, directed attention to Shakespeare’s
knowledge as an Ornithologist. His communication,
however, did not exceed half a dozen pages, in which
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_ix" title="ix"> </a><!--009.png-->
space he has mentioned barely one-fourth of the species
to which Shakespeare has referred. From the cursory
nature of his remarks, moreover, I failed to discover
a reference to any point which I had not already investigated.
It would be unnecessary for me, therefore, to
allude to this article, except for the purpose of acknowledging
that Mr. Barlow was the first to enter upon what,
as regards Shakespeare, may be termed this new field
of research.</p>

<p>The labour of collecting and arranging Shakespeare’s
numerous allusions to birds, has been much greater than
many would suppose, for not only have I derived little or
no benefit from the various editions of his works which
I have consulted, but reference to a glossarial index, or
concordance, has, in nine cases out of ten, resulted in disappointment.
It is due to Mr. Staunton, however, to
state that I have found some of the foot-notes to his
library edition of the Plays very useful.</p>

<p>Although oft-times difficult, it has been my endeavour,
as far as practicable, to connect one with another the
various passages quoted or referred to, so as to render the
whole as readable and as entertaining as possible. With
this view, many allusions have been passed over as being
too trivial to deserve separate notice, but a reference to
them will be found in the Appendix at the end of the
volume,<a id="Marker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="marker">1</a> where all the words quoted are arranged, for
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_x" title="x"> </a><!--010.png-->
convenience, in the order in which they occur in the plays
and poems.</p>

<p>In spelling Shakespeare’s name, I have adopted the
orthography of his friends Ben Jonson and the editors of
the first folio.<a id="Marker_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="marker">2</a></p>

<p>As regards the illustrations, it seems desirable also to
say a few words.</p>

<p>In selecting for my frontispiece a portrait of Shakespeare
as a falconer (a character which I am confident
could not have been foreign to him), I have experienced
considerable difficulty in making choice of a likeness.</p>

<p>Those who have made special inquiries into the authenticity
of the various portraits of Shakespeare, are not
agreed in the results at which they have arrived. This is
to be attributed to the fact that, with the exception of the
Droeshout etching, to which I shall presently state my
objection, no likeness really exists of which a reliable
history can be given without one or more missing links in
the chain of evidence.</p>

<p>There are four portraits which have all more or less
claim to be considered authentic. These are “the Jansen
portrait,” 1610; “the Stratford bust,” prior to 1623; “the
Droeshout etching,” 1623; and “the Chandos portrait,”
of which the precise date is uncertain, but which must
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xi" title="xi"> </a><!--011.png-->
have been painted some years prior to 1616, the year of
Shakespeare’s death.</p>

<p>It would be impossible, within the compass of this
preface, to review all that has been said for and against
these four portraits. Neither will space permit me to
give the history of each in detail. I can only briefly
allude to the chief facts in connection with each, and state
the reasons which have influenced me in selecting the
Chandos portrait.</p>

<p>Mr. Boaden, who was the first to examine into the
authenticity of reputed Shakespeare portraits,<a id="Marker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="marker">3</a> has
evinced a preference for the so-called “Jansen portrait,”
in the collection of the Duke of Somerset, considering it
to have been painted by Cornelius Jansen, in 1610, for
Lord Southampton, the great patron, at that date, of art
and the drama.</p>

<p>The picture, indeed, bears upon the face of it an <span class="no-wrap">inscription&mdash;</span>

<span id="inscription">

Æ<sup>te</sup> 46<br />
1610
</span>

&mdash;which gives much weight to the views
expressed by Mr. Boaden.</p>

<p>It is certain that, in the year mentioned, Jansen was in
England, and that he painted several pictures for Lord
Southampton; it is equally true, that at that date Shakespeare
was in his forty-sixth year. But Mr. Boaden fails
to prove that this particular picture was painted by
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xii" title="xii"> </a><!--012.png-->
Jansen, and that it was ever in the possession of Lord
Southampton, or painted by his order.</p>

<p>As a fine head, and a work of art, it is the one of all
others that I should like to think resembled Shakespeare,
could its history be more satisfactorily detailed.</p>

<p>Many regard as a genuine portrait, the Bust at Stratford-on-Avon,
which is stated to have been executed by
Gerard Johnson, and “probably” under the superintendence
of Dr. John Hall. The precise date of its erection
is not known, but we gather that it was previous to 1623,
from the fact that Leonard Digges has referred to it in
his Lines to the Memory of Shakespeare, prefixed to
the first folio edition of the Plays published in that year.
Mr. Wivell relies very strongly on the circumstance of its
having been originally coloured to nature.<a id="Marker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="marker">4</a> Hence tradition
informs us that the eyes were hazel, the hair and
beard auburn. It must be admitted, however, that a
portrait after death can never be so faithful as a picture
from the life, while no sculptor who examines this bust
can maintain that it was executed from a cast.<a id="Marker_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="marker">5</a></p>

<p>Those who approve of the Droeshout etching, published
in 1623, as a frontispiece to the first folio, find a strong
argument in favour of its being a likeness in the commendatory
lines by Ben Jonson, which accompany it.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii" title="xiii"> </a><!--013.png-->
Jonson knew Shakespeare well, and he says of this
<span class="no-wrap">picture:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“This figure that thou here seest put,</div>
<div class="line">It was for gentle Shakespeare cut;</div>
<div class="line">Wherein the graver had a strife</div>
<div class="line">With Nature to outdoo the life.</div>
<div class="line">O, could he but have drawne his wit</div>

<div class="line">But since he cannot, reader, looke</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>As a work of art it is by no means skilful, and is confessedly
inferior not only to other engravings of that day,
but also to other portraits by Martin Droeshout.</p>

<p>That it bore some likeness to Shakespeare <i>as an actor</i>,
I do not doubt, but that it resembled him as a private
individual when off the stage, I cannot bring myself to
believe. The straight hair and shaven chin which are not
found in other portraits having good claims to be
considered authentic, and the unnaturally high forehead,
which would be caused by the actor’s wearing the wig of
an old man partially bald, suggest at once that when
the original portrait was taken, from which Droeshout
engraved, Shakespeare was dressed as if about to sustain
a part in which he was thought to excel as an actor.</p>

<p>Boaden has conjectured that this portrait represents
Shakespeare in the character of old Knowell, in Ben
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv" title="xiv"> </a><!--014.png-->
Jonson’s <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>, a part which
he is known to have played in 1598, and this would
easily account for Ben Jonson’s commendation.<a id="Marker_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="marker">6</a> This
conjecture is so extremely probable, that I have no
hesitation in endorsing it.</p>

<p>We come, then, now to “the Chandos portrait.” With
the longest pedigree of any, it possesses at least as much
collateral evidence of probability, and is, moreover,
important as belonging to the nation.<a id="Marker_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="marker">7</a> It has been
traced back to the possession of Shakespeare’s godson,
William, afterwards Sir William, Davenant, and all that
seems to be wanting materially, is the artist’s name.
The general opinion is, that it was painted either by
Burbage or Taylor, both of whom were fellow-players
of Shakespeare. It is styled the Chandos portrait from
having come to the trustees of the National Portrait
Gallery from the collection of the Duke of Chandos
and Buckingham, through the Earl of Ellesmere, by
whom it was purchased and presented. The history
of the picture, so far as it can be ascertained, is as
<span class="no-wrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It was originally the property of Taylor, the player
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xv" title="xv"> </a><!--015.png-->
(our poet’s Hamlet), by whom, or by Richard Burbage,
it was painted.<a id="Marker_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="marker">8</a></p>

<p>Taylor dying about the year 1653, at the advanced
age of seventy,<a id="Marker_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="marker">9</a> left this picture by will to Davenant.<a id="Marker_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="marker">10</a>
At the death of Davenant, who died intestate in 1663,
it was bought, probably at a sale of his effects, by
Betterton, the actor.</p>

<p>While in Betterton’s possession, it was engraved by
Van der Gucht, for Rowe’s edition of Shakespeare, in
1709. Betterton dying without a will and in needy
circumstances, his pictures were sold. Some were bought
by Bullfinch, the printseller, who sold them again to
a Mr. Sykes. The portrait of Shakespeare was purchased
by Mrs. Barry, the actress, who afterwards sold it
for forty guineas to Mr. Robert Keck, of the Inner Temple.</p>

<p>While in his possession, an engraving was made from
it, in 1719, by Vertue, and it then passed to Mr.
Nicholls, of Southgate, Middlesex, who acquired it on
marrying the heiress of the Keck family.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Caernarvon, afterwards Duke of
Chandos, marrying the daughter of Mr. Nicholls, it
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi" title="xvi"> </a><!--016.png-->
then became his Grace’s property. When his pictures
were sold at Stowe, in September, 1848, this portrait
was purchased for three hundred and fifty-five guineas
by the Earl of Ellesmere, who, in March, 1856, presented
it to the Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery, in
whose hands it still remains.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this pedigree, the picture has been
objected to on the ground that the dark hair and
foreign complexion could never have belonged to our
essentially English Shakespeare. Those who make this
objection, seem to forget entirely the age of the portrait,
and the fact that it is painted in oil and on canvas, a
circumstance which of itself is quite sufficient, after
the lapse of two centuries and a half, to account for
the dark tone which now pervades it, to say nothing
of the numerous touches and retouches to which it has
been subjected at the hands of its various owners.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the missing links of evidence, it
seems to me that, having traced the picture back to
the possession of Shakespeare’s godson, we have gone
far enough to justify us in accepting it as an authentic
portrait in preference to many others. For we cannot
suppose that Sir William Davenant would retain in
his possession until his death a picture of one with
whom he was personally acquainted, unless he considered
that it was sufficiently faithful as a likeness to
remind him of the original.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii" title="xvii"> </a><!--017.png-->

<p>On the score of pedigree, then, and because I believe
that the only well-authenticated portrait (<i>i.e.</i>, the Droeshout)
represents Shakespeare as an actor, and not as
a private individual, I have selected the Chandos portrait
for my frontispiece.</p>

<p>By obtaining a reduced photograph of this <i>upon wood</i>,
from the best engraving, and “vignetting” it, I have been
enabled to place upon the left hand a hooded falcon,
drawn by the unrivalled pencil of Mr. Wolf, and thus
to entrust to the engraver, Mr. Pearson, a faithful likeness
of man and bird.</p>

<p>As regards the other illustrations, my acknowledgments
are due to Mr. J.&nbsp;G. Keulemans for the artistic
manner in which he has executed my designs, and to
Mr. Pearson for the careful way in which he has engraved
them.</p>

<p>With these observations, I conclude an undertaking
which has occupied my leisure hours for six years, but
which indeed has been, in every sense of the word,
“a labour of love.”</p>

<p>Should the reader, on closing this volume, consider its
design but imperfectly executed, it is hoped that he will
still have gleaned from it enough curious information to
compensate him for the disappointment.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">
<img src="images/pg1.jpg" id="pg1" width="500" height="140" alt="Deer-shooting" /><br />
INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>BEFORE proceeding to examine the ornithology of
Shakespeare, it may be well to take a glance at
his knowledge of natural history in general.</p>

<p>Pope has expressed the opinion that whatever object of
nature or branch of science Shakespeare either speaks of
or describes, it is always with competent if not with
exclusive knowledge. His descriptions are always exact,
his metaphors appropriate, and remarkably drawn from
the true nature and inherent qualities of each subject.
There can indeed be little doubt that Shakespeare must
have derived the greater portion of his knowledge of
nature from his own observation, and no one can fail to be
delighted with the variety and richness of the images
which he has by this means produced.</p>

<p>Whether we accompany him to the woods and fields,
midst “daisies pied and violets blue,” or sit with him
“under the shade of melancholy boughs,” whether we
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_2" title="2"> </a><!--026.png-->
follow him to “the brook that brawls along the wood,” or
to that sea “whose rocky shore beats back the envious
siege of watery Neptune,” we are alike instructed by his
observations, and charmed with his apt descriptions.
How often do the latter strike us as echoes of our own
experience, sent forth in fitter tones than we could find.</p>

<p>A sportsman is oft-times more or less a naturalist. His
rambles in search of game bring him in contact with
creatures of such curious structure and habits, with insects
and plants of such rare beauty, that the purpose of his
walk is for the time forgotten, and he turns aside from
sport, to admire and learn from nature.</p>

<p>That Shakespeare was both a sportsman and a
naturalist, there is much evidence to show. During the
age in which he lived “hawking” was much in vogue.
Throughout the Plays, we find frequent allusions to this
sport, and the accurate employment of terms used exclusively
in falconry, as well as the beautiful metaphors
derived therefrom, prove that our poet had much practical
knowledge on the subject. We shall have occasion later
to discuss his knowledge of falconry at greater length.
It will suffice for the present to observe that there are
many passages in the Plays which to one unacquainted
with the habits of animals and birds, or ignorant of
hawking phraseology, would be wholly unintelligible, but
which are otherwise found to contain the most beautiful
and forcible metaphors. As instances of this may be cited
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_3" title="3"> </a><!--027.png-->
that passage in <i>Othello</i> (Act iii. Sc. 3), where the Moor
compares his suspected wife to a “haggard falcon,” and
the hawking scene in Act ii. of the Second Part of <i>King
Henry VI.</i><a id="Marker_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="marker">11</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare, although a contemplative man, appears to
have found but little “recreation” in fishing, and the most
enthusiastic disciple of Izaak Walton would find it difficult
to illustrate a work on angling with quotations from
Shakespeare. He might refer us to <i>Twelfth Night</i> (Act ii.
Sc. 5), where Maria, on the appearance of Malvolio, exclaims,
“Here comes the <i>trout</i> that must be caught with
tickling;” and to the song of Caliban in <i>The Tempest</i>
(Act ii. Sc. 2), “No more dams I’ll make for fish.”
Possibly, by straining a point or two, he might ask with
Benedick, in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> (Act i. Sc. 1),
“Do you play the flouting Jack?”</p>

<p>But our poet seems to have <span class="no-wrap">considered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish</div>
<div class="line">Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,</div>
<div class="line">And greedily devour the treacherous bait.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Much Ado</i>, Act iii. Sc. 1.<a id="Marker_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="marker">12</a></div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_4" title="4"> </a><!--028.png-->

<p>His forte lay more in hunting and fowling than in
fishing,<a id="Marker_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="marker">13</a> and in all that relates to deer-stalking (as practised
in his day, when the deer was killed with cross-bow
or bow and arrow), to deer-hunting with hounds, and to
coursing, we find him fully informed.</p>

<p>In the less noble art of bird-catching<a id="Marker_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="marker">14</a> he was probably
no mean adept, while the knowledge which he displays of
the habits of our wild animals, as the fox, the badger, the
weasel, and the wild cat, could only have been acquired by
one accustomed to much observation by flood and field.</p>

<p>On each of these subjects a chapter might be written,
but it will suffice for our present purpose to draw attention
only to some of the more remarkable passages in support
of the assertions above made.</p>

<p>Deer-shooting was a favourite sport of both sexes in
Shakespeare’s day, and to enable the ladies to enjoy it in
safety, “stands,” or “standings,” were erected in many
parks, and concealed with boughs. From these the
ladies with bow and arrow, or cross-bow, shot at
the deer as they were driven past them by the keepers.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_5" title="5"> </a><!--029.png-->

<p>Queen Elizabeth was extremely fond of this sport, and
the nobility who entertained her in her different progresses,
made large hunting parties, which she usually
joined when the weather was favourable. She frequently
amused herself in following the hounds. “Her Majesty,”
says a courtier, writing to Sir Robert Sidney, “is well
and excellently disposed to hunting, for every second day
she is on horseback, and continues the sport long.”<a id="Marker_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="marker">15</a> At
this time Her Majesty had just entered the seventy-seventh
year of her age, and was then at her palace at
Oatlands. Often, when she was not disposed to hunt
herself, she was entertained with a sight of the sport.
At Cowdray Park, Sussex, then the seat of Lord Montagu
(1591), Her Majesty one day after dinner saw “sixteen
bucks, all having fayre lawe, pulled downe with greyhounds
in a laund or lawn.”<a id="Marker_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="marker">16</a></p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the ladies of England, with the
royal example before their eyes, found such delight in
the chase during the age of which we speak, and not
content with being mere spectators, vied with each other
in the skilful use of the bow.</p>

<p>To this pastime Shakespeare has made frequent
allusion.</p>

<p>In <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, the first scene of the fourth
act is laid in a park, where the Princess <span class="no-wrap">asks,&mdash;</span></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" title="6"> </a><!--030.png-->

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Then, forester,<a id="Marker_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="marker">17</a> my friend, where is the bush</div>
<div class="line">That we must stand and play the murtherer in?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To which the forester <span class="no-wrap">replies,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;</div>
<div class="line">A ‘stand’ where you may make the fairest shoot.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in <i>Henry VI.</i> Part III. Act iii. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 1,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Under this thick-grown brake we’ll shroud ourselves;</div>
<div class="line">For through this laund anon the deer will come;</div>
<div class="line">And in this covert will we make our ‘stand,’</div>
<div class="line">Culling the principal of all the deer.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, in <i>Cymbeline</i> (Act iii. Sc. 4), “When thou hast
ta’en thy ‘stand,’ the elected deer before thee.” Other
passages might be mentioned, but it will be sufficient
to refer only to <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> (Act v.
Sc. 5), and to the song in <i>As You Like It</i> (Act iv.
Sc. 2), commencing “What shall he have that kill’d the
deer?”</p>

<p>Deer-stealing in Shakespeare’s day was regarded only as
a youthful frolic. Antony Wood (“Athen. Oxon.” i. 371),
speaking of Dr. John Thornborough, who was admitted a
member of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1570, at the age

of eighteen, and who was successively Bishop of Limerick
and Bishop of Bristol and Worcester, informs us, that he
and his kinsman, Robert Pinkney, “seldom studied or
gave themselves to their books, but spent their time
in the fencing schools, and dancing schools, in stealing
deer and conies, in hunting the hare and wooing girls.”</p>

<p>Shakespeare himself has been accused of this indiscretion.
The story is first told in print by Rowe, in his “Life
of Shakespeare”:&mdash;“He had, by a misfortune common
enough to young fellows, fallen into ill company, and
amongst them some that made a frequent practice of
deer-stealing engaged him more than once in robbing a
park that belonged to Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote,
near Stratford. For this he was prosecuted by that
gentleman, as he thought somewhat too severely; and in
order to revenge that ill-usage, he made a ballad upon
him. And though this, probably the first essay of his
poetry, be lost, yet it is said to have been so very bitter,
that it redoubled the prosecution against him to that
degree, that he was obliged to leave his business and
family in Warwickshire, for some time, and shelter himself
in London.”</p>

<p>Mr. Staunton, in his library edition of Shakespeare’s
Plays, says: “What degree of authenticity the story possesses
will never probably be known. Rowe derived his
version of it no doubt through Betterton; but Davies
makes no allusion to the source from which he drew his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" title="8"> </a><!--032.png-->
information, and we are left to grope our way, so far as
this important incident is concerned, mainly by the light
of collateral circumstances. These, it must be admitted,
serve in some respects to confirm the tradition. Shakespeare
certainly quitted Stratford-upon-Avon when a young
man, and it could have been no ordinary impulse which
drove him to leave wife, children, friends, and occupation,
to take up his abode among strangers in a distant
place.</p>

<p>“Then there is the pasquinade, and the unmistakable
identification of Sir Thomas Lucy as Justice Shallow,
in the Second Part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, and in the opening
scene of <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>. The genuineness
of the former may be doubted; but the ridicule
in the Plays betokens a latent hostility to the Lucy
family, which is unaccountable, except upon the
supposition that the deerstealing foray is founded on
facts.”</p>

<p>The more legitimate sport in killing deer was by means
of blood-hounds, and in <i>The Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>
we are furnished with an accurate description of the dogs
in most <span class="no-wrap">repute:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the <i>Comedy of Errors</i> (Act iv. Sc. 2), Dromio of
Syracuse alludes to “a hound that runs counter, and yet

we have the following animated <span class="no-wrap">dialogue:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We will therefore only glance at that amusing scene
in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> (Act v. Sc. 5), where
Falstaff appears in Windsor Forest, disguised with a
buck’s head on. “Divide me,” says he, “like a brib’d-buck,
each a haunch: I will keep my sides to myself,
my shoulders for the fellow of this walk, and my horns
I bequeath your husbands.”</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_10" title="10"> </a><!--034.png-->

<p>We have here an allusion to the ancient method of
“breaking up” a deer.<a id="Marker_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="marker">18</a> “The fellow of this walk” is the
forester, to whom it was customary on such occasions to
present a shoulder. Dame Juliana Berners, in her “Boke

<p>And in Turbervile’s “Book of Hunting,” 1575, the
distribution of the various parts of a deer is minutely
described.</p>

<p>The touching description of a wounded stag, in <i>As You

<p>Although the deer, as the nobler animal, has received
more attention from our poet than the fox and the hare,

<p>receives his share of notice, although it is not always in
his praise, and “subtle as the fox” has become a proverb
(<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act iii. Sc. 3).</p>

<p>From the “subtle fox” to the “timorous hare,” the
transition is easy. What “more a coward than a hare”?
(<i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act iii. Sc. 5.)</p>

<p>In Roxburgh and Aberdeen, as we learn from Jamieson’s
“Scottish Dictionary,” a hare is termed “a bawd,”
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" title="12"> </a><!--036.png-->

<p>In a printed broadside of the time of Queen Anne,
in the collection of the Society of Antiquaries of London,
is the following curious fable relating to the <span class="no-wrap">Bat:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">“615. <span class="small-caps">The Birds and Beasts.</span> A Fable.</div>

<p>“Once the Birds and Beasts strove for the prerogative:
the neuter Batt, seeing the Beasts prevail, goes to them
and shows them her large forehead, long ears, and teeth:
afterwards, when the Birds prevail’d, the Batt flies with
the Birds, and sings chit, chit, chat, and shows them her
wings.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Hence Beakless Bird, hence Winged Beast, they cry’d;</div>

</p>
</blockquote>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="15"> </a><!--039.png-->

<p>In alluding to the “venom toad” as “mark’d by the
destinies to be avoided,” Shakespeare probably only treated
it as other writers had done before him, and, without any
personal investigation of the matter, ranked it with the
viper and other poisonous reptiles, when in fact it is perfectly
harmless.</p>

<p>The habit which the snake has, in common with other
reptiles, of periodically casting its skin or slough, is frequently
alluded to in the Plays, where that covering is
sometimes called “the enamell’d skin” (<i>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i>, Act ii. Sc. 1); at other times the “casted
slough” (<i>Henry V.</i> Act iv. Sc. 1, and <i>Twelfth Night</i>,
Act iii. Sc. 4); and the “shining checker’d slough”
(<i>Henry VI.</i> Part II. Act iii. Sc. 1).</p>

<p>It is difficult to say why the Adder is supposed to be
deaf, unless because it has no visible ears&mdash;but then the
term would apply to other reptiles. Shakespeare has
several times alluded to this. In the Second Part of <i>King
Henry VI.</i> Act iii. Sc. 2, Queen Margaret asks the
<span class="no-wrap">King,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“What, art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?”</div>
</div>

<p>And in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2, Hector
says to Paris and <span class="no-wrap">Troilus,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i10">              “Pleasure and revenge</div>
<div class="line">Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</div>
<div class="line">Of any true decision.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" title="16"> </a><!--040.png-->

<p>Again, in Sonnet CXII., “the adder’s sense” is referred
to in such a way as to leave no doubt of the poet’s
impression that adders do not hear.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>The “eyeless venom’d worm” referred to in <i>Timon of
Athens</i>, Act iv. Sc. 3, is of course the Slow-worm (<i>Anguis
fragilis</i>).</p>

<p>The observant naturalist must doubtless have remarked
the partiality evinced by snakes and other reptiles for
basking in the sun. Shakespeare has noticed <span class="no-wrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Passing to the insect world, we may well be astonished
at the number of species to which Shakespeare has alluded.
Although the same attention has not been given to the
insects as to the birds, the following have, nevertheless,
been noted. Many others, doubtless, have been overlooked.</p>

<p>The Beetle (<i>Macbeth</i>, Act iii. Sc. 2; <i>King Lear</i>, Act iv.
Sc. 6; <i>Measure for Measure</i>, Act iii. Sc. 1). The Grasshopper
(<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act i. Sc. 4). The Cricket,
(<i>Pericles</i>, Act iii. Introduction; <i>Winter’s Tale</i>, Act ii.
Sc. 1; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act i. Sc. 4; <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act ii.
Sc. 2). The Glowworm (<i>Hamlet</i>, Act i. Sc. 5); and the

or Brize (<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act i. Sc. 3). The Grey-coated
Gnat (<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act i. Sc. 4; <i>Comedy of
Errors</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2); the Wasp (<i>Taming of the Shrew</i>,
Act ii. Sc. 1; <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act i. Sc. 2;
<i>Henry VIII.</i> Act iii. Sc. 2); the Drone (<i>Henry V.</i> Act i.

<p>This is but one of the many lessons taught us by
Shakespeare in his allusions to the animal world, and the
kindly spirit which characterizes all his dealings with
animals is frequently exemplified throughout the Plays;
perhaps nowhere so clearly as in <i>Measure for Measure</i>,
Act iii. Sc. 1, where we are <span class="no-wrap">told&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Probably enough has been said to show the reader that
Shakespeare’s knowledge of natural history was by no
means slight, and if it be thought to have been only
general, it was, at all events, accurate. The use which he
has made of this knowledge, throughout his works, in
depicting virtue and vice in their true colours, in pointing
out lessons of industry, patience, and mercy, and in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" title="21"> </a><!--045.png-->
showing the profit to be derived from a study of natural
objects, is everywhere apparent.</p>

<p>But to come to the Ornithology. The accurate observations
on this subject, the apt allusions, and the beautiful
metaphors to be met with throughout the Plays, may be
said to owe their origin mainly to three causes. Firstly,
Shakespeare had a good practical knowledge of Falconry,
a pastime which, being much in vogue in his day, brought
under his notice, almost of necessity, many wild birds,
exclusive of the various species which were hawked at
and killed. Secondly, he was a great reader, and, possessing
a good memory, was enabled subsequently to
express in verse ideas which had been suggested by
older authors. Thirdly, and most important of all, he was
a genuine naturalist, and gathered a large amount of
information from his own practical observations. In all
his walks, he evidently did not fail to note even the
most trivial facts in natural history, and these were
treasured up in his memory, to be called forth as occasion
required, to be aptly and eloquently introduced into his
works.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="22"> </a><!--046.png-->

<p>Apart from the consideration that a poet may be
expected, almost of necessity, to invoke the birds of song,
Shakespeare has gone further, and displays a greater
knowledge of ornithology, and a greater accuracy in his
statements, than is generally the case with poets. How
far we shall succeed in proving this assertion, it will be for
the reader of the following pages to determine.</p>

CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EAGLE AND THE LARGER BIRDS OF PREY.</span></h2>

<p>AT the head of the diurnal birds of prey, most authors
have agreed in placing the Eagles. Their large size,
powerful flight, and great muscular strength, give them a
superiority which is universally admitted. In reviewing,
therefore, the birds of which Shakespeare has made mention,
no apology seems to be necessary for commencing
with the genus <i>Aquila</i>.</p>

<p>Throughout the works of our great dramatist, frequent
allusions may be found to an eagle, but the word “eagle”
is almost always employed in a generic sense, and in a
few instances only can we infer, from the context, that a
particular species is indicated. Indeed, it is not improbable
that in the poet’s opinion only one species of
eagle existed. Be this as it may, the introduction of an
eagle and his attributes, by way of simile or metaphor,
has been accomplished by Shakespeare with much beauty
and effect. Considered as the emblem of majesty, the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="24"> </a><!--048.png-->
eagle has been variously styled “the king of birds,” “the
royal bird,” “the princely eagle,” and “Jove’s bird,” while
so great is his power of vision, that an “eagle eye” has
become proverbial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POWER OF VISION.</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i8">        “Behold, his eye,</div>

</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Richard II.</i> Act iii. Sc. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>The clearness of vision in birds is indeed extraordinary,
and has been calculated, by the eminent French naturalist
Lacépède, to be nine times more extensive than that of
the farthest-sighted man. The opinion that the eagle
possessed the power of gazing undazzled at the sun, is
of great antiquity. Pliny relates that it exposes its
brood to this test as soon as hatched, to prove if they be
genuine or not. Chaucer refers to the belief in his
“Assemblie of <span class="no-wrap">Foules”:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“There mighten men the royal egal find,</div>
<div class="line">That with his sharp look persith the sonne.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So also Spenser, in his “Hymn of Heavenly <span class="no-wrap">Beauty,”&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“And like the native brood of eagle’s kind,</div>
<div class="line">On that bright sun of glory fix their eyes.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that Shakespeare has
borrowed the <span class="no-wrap">idea:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But in the same play and scene we are <span class="no-wrap">told&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.”</div>

</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act iii. Sc. 5.</div>
</div>

<p>The supposition that the eye of the eagle is green
must be regarded as a poetic license. In all the species
of this genus with which we are acquainted, the colour of
the iris is either hazel or yellow. But it would be absurd
to look for exactness in trifles such as these.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POWER OF FLIGHT.</div>

<p>The power of flight in the eagle is no less surprising
than his power of vision. Birds of this kind have been
killed which measured seven or eight feet from tip to tip
of wing, and were strong enough to carry off hares, lambs,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="26"> </a><!--050.png-->
and even young children. This strength of wing is not
unnoticed by <span class="no-wrap">Shakespeare:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="line">Leaving no track behind.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Timon of Athens</i>, Act i. Sc. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>This last line recalls to mind the following allusion to
the flight of the Jerfalcon:&mdash;“Then prone she dashes
with so much velocity, that the impression of her path
remains on the eye, in the same manner as that of the
shooting meteor or flashing lightning, and you fancy that
there is a torrent of falcon rushing for fathoms through
the air.”<a id="Marker_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="marker">26</a></p>

<p>Spenser, in the fifth book of his “Faerie Queene”
(iv. 42), has depicted the grandeur of an eagle on the
<span class="no-wrap">wing:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Like to an eagle in his kingly pride</div>
<div class="line">Soring thro’ his wide empire of the aire</div>
<div class="line">To weather his brode sailes.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But notwithstanding his great powers of flight, we are
reminded that the eagle is not always secure. Guns,
traps, and other engines of destruction are directed against
him, whenever and wheresoever opportunity <span class="no-wrap">occurs:&mdash;</span></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" title="27"> </a><!--051.png-->

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“And often, to our comfort, shall we find</div>
<div class="line">The sharded beetle in a safer hold</div>

</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Cymbeline</i>, Act iii. Sc. 3.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A GOOD OMEN.</div>

<p>With the Romans, the eagle was a bird of good omen.
Josephus, the Jewish historian, says the eagle was selected
for the Roman legionary standard, because he is the king
of all birds, and the most powerful of them all, whence he
has become the emblem of empire, and the omen of
victory.<a id="Marker_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="marker">27</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, we read in <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, Act v. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 1:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</div>
<div class="line">Two mighty eagles fell; and there they perch’d,</div>
<div class="line">Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This incident is more fully detailed in North’s “Plutarch,”
as follows:&mdash;“When they raised their campe,
there came two eagles, that flying with a marvellous force,
lighted upon two of the foremost ensigns, and alwaies followed
the souldiers, which gave them meate and fed them,
untill they came neare to the citie of Phillipes; and there
one day onely before the battell, they both flew away.”</p>

<p>The ensign of the eagle was not peculiar, however, to
the Romans. The golden eagle, with extended wings,
was borne by the Persian monarchs,<a id="Marker_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="marker">28</a> and it is not improbable
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="28"> </a><!--052.png-->
that from them the Romans adopted it; while the
Persians themselves may have borrowed the symbol from
the ancient Assyrians, on whose banners it waved until
Babylon was conquered by Cyrus.</p>

<p>As a bird of good omen, the eagle is often mentioned
by <span class="no-wrap">Shakespeare:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“I chose an eagle, and did avoid a puttock.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Cymbeline</i>, Act i. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>The name “Puttock” has been applied both to the
Kite and the Common Buzzard, and both were considered
birds of ill omen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BIRD OF JOVE.</div>

<p>In Act iv. Sc. 2, of the same play, we <span class="no-wrap">read,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“I saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d</div>
<div class="line">From the spungy south to this part of the west,</div>
<div class="line">There vanish’d in the sunbeams.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was said to portend success to the Roman host.
In Izaak Walton’s “Compleat Angler,” we are furnished
with a reason for styling the eagle “Jove’s bird.” The
falconer, in discoursing on the merits of his recreation with
a brother angler, says,&mdash;“In the air my troops of hawks
soar upon high, and when they are lost in the sight of
men, then they attend upon and converse with the gods;
therefore I think my eagle is so justly styled Jove’s
servant in ordinary.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROMAN EAGLE.</div>

<p>In a paper “On the Roman Imperial and Crested
Eagles,”<a id="Marker_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="marker">29</a> Mr. Hogg says,&mdash;“The Roman Eagle, which
is generally termed the Imperial Eagle, is represented with
its head <i>plain</i>, that is to say, <i>not crested</i>. It is in appearance
the same as the attendant bird of the ‘king of gods
and men,’ and is generally represented as standing at the
foot of his throne, or sometimes as the bearer of his
thunder and lightning. Indeed he also often appears
perched on the top of his sceptre. He is always considered
as the attribute or emblem of ‘Father Jove.’”</p>

<p>A good copy of this bird of Jupiter, called by Virgil
and Ovid “Jovis armiger,” from an antique group, representing
the eagle and Ganymedes, may be seen in Bell’s
“Pantheon,” vol. i. Also “a small bronze eagle, the
ensign of a Roman legion,” is given in Duppa’s “Travels
in Sicily” (2nd ed., 1829, tab. iv.). That traveller states,
that the original bronze figure is preserved in the Museum
of the Convent of St. Nicholas d’Arcun, at Catania. This
Convent is now called Convento di S. Benedetto, according
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="30"> </a><!--054.png-->
to Mr. G. Dennis, in his “Handbook of Sicily,”
(p. 349); and he mentions this ensign as “a Roman
legionary eagle in excellent preservation.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENSIGN OF THE EAGLE.</div>

<p>From the second century before Christ, the eagle is said
to have become the sole military ensign, and it was mostly
small in size, because Florus (lib. 4, cap. 12) relates that
an ensign-bearer, in the wars of Julius Cæsar, in order to
prevent the enemy from taking it, pulled off the eagle
from the top of the gilt pole, and hid it by placing it
under cover of his belt.</p>

<p>In later times, the eagle was borne with the legion,
which, indeed, occasionally took its name, “<i>aquila</i>.” This
eagle, which was also adopted by the Roman emperors
for their imperial symbol, is considered to be the <i>Aquila
heliaca</i> of Savigny (<i>imperialis</i> of Temminck), and resembles
our golden eagle, <i>Aquila chrysaëtos</i>, in plumage, though
of a darker brown, and with more or less white on the
scapulars. It differs also in the structure of the foot. It
inhabits Southern Europe, North Africa, Palestine, and
India. Living examples of this species may be seen at
the present time in the Gardens of the Zoological Society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HABITS AND ATTITUDES.</div>

<p>Sicilius, in <i>Cymbeline</i> (Act v. Sc. 4), speaking of the
apparition and descent of Jupiter, who was seated upon
an eagle, <span class="no-wrap">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i16">                          “The holy eagle</div>

<div class="line">Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,</div>
<div class="line">As when his god is pleas’d.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“<i>Prune</i>” signifies to clean and adjust the feathers, and
is synonymous with <i>plume</i>. A word more generally used,
perhaps, than either, is <i>preen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cloys</i> is, doubtless, a misprint for <i>cleys</i>, that is, <i>claws</i>.
Those who have kept hawks must often have observed
the habit which they have of raising one foot, and
whetting the beak against it. This is the action to
which Shakespeare refers. The same word occurs in
Ben Jonson’s “Underwoods,” (vii. 29) <span class="no-wrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>The verb “to cloy” has a very different signification,
namely, “to satiate,” “choke,” or “clog up.” Shakespeare
makes frequent use of it.</p>

<p>In “Lucrece” it <span class="no-wrap">occurs:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“But poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,</div>
<div class="line">That, <i>cloy’d</i> with much, he pineth still for more.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again, in <i>Richard II.</i> (Act i. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 3):&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“O, who can hold a fire in his hand,</div>

</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="32"> </a><!--056.png-->

<p>Sometimes the word was written “accloy;” as, for instance,
in Spenser’s “Faerie Queene” <span class="no-wrap">(ii. 7)&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“And with uncomely weeds the gentle wave <i>accloyes</i>.”</div>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line quote">“The mouldie mosse which thee <i>accloyeth</i>.”</div>
</div>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the word occurring in the
fourth scene of the fifth act of <i>Cymbeline</i>, should be written
<i>cleys</i>, and not <i>cloys</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EAGLE’S EGGS.</div>

<p>But to return from this digression; there is a passage in
the first act of <i>Henry V.</i> Sc. 2, which seems to deserve
some notice while on the subject of eagles, <span class="no-wrap"><i>i.e.:</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“For once the eagle England being in prey,</div>
<div class="line">To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot</div>
<div class="line">Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That the weasel sucks eggs, and is partial to such fare,
is very generally admitted. Shakespeare alludes to the
fact again in <i>As You Like It</i> (Act ii. Sc. 5), where
Jaques says:&mdash;“I can suck melancholy out of a song, as
a weasel sucks eggs.” But whether the weasel has ever
been found in the same situation or at such an altitude as
the eagle, is not so certain. A near relative of the weasel,
however, namely, a marten-cat, was once found in an
eagle’s nest. “The forester, having reason to think that
the bird was sitting hard, peeped over the cliff into the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" title="33"> </a><!--057.png-->
eyrie. To his amazement, a marten was suckling her
kittens in comfortable enjoyment.”<a id="Marker_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="marker">30</a></p>

<p>The allusion above made to the “princely eggs,”
reminds us of the princely bird which laid them, and
those who have read the works of Shakespeare&mdash;and who
has not?&mdash;must doubtless remember the beautiful simile
uttered by Warwick when dying on the field of <span class="no-wrap">Barnet:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The great age to which this bird sometimes attains has
been remarked by most writers on Ornithology. The
Psalmist has beautifully alluded to it where he says of the
righteous man,&mdash;“His youth shall be renewed like the
eagle’s.” A golden eagle, which had been nine years in
the possession of Mr. Owen Holland, of Conway, lived
thirty-two years with the gentleman who made him a

received it from Ireland is unknown.<a id="Marker_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="marker">31</a> Another, that died
at Vienna, was stated to have lived in confinement one
hundred and four years.<a id="Marker_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="marker">32</a> A white-tailed eagle captured
in Caithness, died at Duff House in February,
1862, having been kept in confinement, by the late Earl

<p>In an old French “riddle-book,” entitled “Demands

It is here transcribed, as bearing upon the subject

<div class="sidenote">ITS AGE COMPUTED.</div>

<p>The Rev. W.&nbsp;B. Daniel alludes<a id="Marker_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="marker">33</a> to “the received
maxim that animals live seven times the number of years
that bring them to perfection,” upon which computation
the average life of an eagle would be twenty-one years.
But this maxim is founded on a misconception. Fleurens,
in his treatise “De la Longévité Humaine,” says that the
duration of life in any animal is equal to five times the
number of years requisite to perfect its growth, and
that the growth has ceased when the bones have finally
consolidated with their <i>epiphyses</i>, which in the young are
merely cartilages.</p>

<p>Like many other rapacious birds, eagles are very fond
of bathing, and it has been found essential to supply them
with baths when in confinement, in order to keep them
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" title="36"> </a><!--060.png-->
in good health. The freshness and vigour which they
thus derive is alluded to in <i>Henry IV.</i> (Part I. Act iv.

<p>The larger birds of prey are no less fond of washing,
though they care so little for water to drink, that it has
been erroneously asserted that they never drink. “What
I observed,” says the Abbé Spallanzani,<a id="Marker_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="marker">34</a> “is, that eagles,
when left even for several months without water, did not
seem to suffer the smallest inconvenience from the want of
it, but when they were supplied with water, they not only
got into the vessel and sprinkled their feathers like other
birds, but repeatedly dipped the beak, then raised the
head, in the manner of common fowls, and swallowed
what they had taken up. Hence it is evident that they
drink.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EAGLES TRAINED FOR HAWKING.</div>

<p>In Persia, Tartary, India, and other parts of the East,
the eagle was formerly, and is still to a certain extent,
used for hunting down the larger birds and beasts. In
the thirteenth century, the Khan of Tartary kept upwards
of two hundred hawks and eagles, some of which had been
trained to catch wolves; and such was the boldness and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" title="37"> </a><!--061.png-->
power of these birds, that none, however large, could
escape from their talons.<a id="Marker_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="marker">35</a></p>

<p>Burton, in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,”<a id="Marker_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="marker">36</a> quoting
from Sir Antony Shirley’s “Travels,” says: “The Muscovian
Emperours reclaim eagles, to let fly at hindes, foxes,
&amp;c., and such a one was sent for a present to Queen
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>A traveller to the Putrid Sea, in 1819, wrote: “Wolves
are very common on these steppes; and they are so bold
that they sometimes attack travellers. We passed by a
large one, lying on the ground with an eagle, which had
probably attacked him, by his side. Its talons were nearly
buried in his back; in the struggle both had died.”<a id="Marker_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="marker">37</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TIRING.</div>

<p>Owing to the great difficulty in training them, as well
as to the difficulty in obtaining them, eagles have rarely
been trained to the chase in England. Some years since,
Captain Green, of Buckden, in Huntingdonshire, had a
fine golden eagle, which he had taught to take hares and
rabbits;<a id="Marker_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="marker">38</a> and this species has been found to be more
tractable than any other.</p>

<p>Whether Shakespeare was aware of the use of
trained eagles or not, we cannot say, but he has in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_38" title="38"> </a><!--062.png-->
many cases employed hawking terms in connection with
this <span class="no-wrap">bird:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The meaning of the word <i>tire</i> is thus explained by
falconers. When a hawk was in training, it was often
necessary to prolong her meal as much as possible, to
prevent her from gorging; this was effected by giving her
a tough or bony bit to <i>tire on;</i> that is, to tear, or pull at.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLE’S EYRIE.</div>

<p>In the following passage, two hawking terms are used in
connection with the <span class="no-wrap">eagle:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i4">    “Know, the gallant monarch is in arms,</div>
<div class="line">And, like an eagle o’er his aiery, <i>towers</i>,</div>
<div class="line">To <i>souse</i> annoyance that comes near his nest.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>King John</i>, Act v. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" title="39"> </a><!--063.png-->

<p>This passage has been differently rendered, by removing
the punctuation between “aiery” and “towers,” and
reading the former “airey” or “airy,” and making
“towers” a substantive. But the meaning of the passage,
as it stands above, seems to us sufficiently clear.</p>

<p>“Aiery” is equivalent to “eyrie,” the nesting-place.
The word occurs again in <i>Richard III.</i> (Act i. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 3):&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“Our <i>aiery</i> buildeth in the cedar’s top;”</div>
</div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“Your <i>aiery</i> buildeth in our <i>aiery’s</i> nest.”</div>
</div>

<p>The verb “to tower,” in the language of falconry,
signifies “to rise spirally to a height.” Compare the
French “<i>tour</i>.” As a further argument, too, for reading
“towers” as a verb, and not as a substantive, compare the
following passage from <i>Macbeth</i>, which plainly shows that
Shakespeare was not unacquainted with this word as a
hawking <span class="no-wrap">term:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“A falcon <i>towering</i> in her pride of place.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Macbeth</i>, Act ii. Sc. 4.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE FATAL SWOOP.</div>

<p>The word “souse,” above quoted, is likewise borrowed
from the language of falconry, and, as a substantive, is
equivalent to “swoop.” It would seem to be derived
from the German “sausen,” which signifies to rush with
a whistling sound like the wind; and this is certainly
expressive of the “whish” made by the wings of a falcon
when swooping on her prey.</p>

<p>There is a good illustration of this passage in Drayton’s
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="40"> </a><!--064.png-->
“Polyolbion,” Song xx., where a description of hawking
at wild-fowl is given. After the falconers have put
up the fowl from the sedge, the hawk, in the words
of the author, having previously “towered,” “gives it a
souse.” Beaumont and Fletcher also make use of this
word as a hawking term in <i>The Chances</i>, iv. 1; and it
occurs in Spenser’s “Faerie Queene,” Book iv. Canto v. 30.</p>

<p>A notice of the various hawks made use of by falconers,
and mentioned by Shakespeare, might be here properly
introduced, but it will be more convenient to reserve this
notice for a separate chapter, and confine our attention
for the present to the larger diurnal birds of prey which,
like the eagles, are seldom, if ever, reclaimed by man.</p>

<p>Of these, excluding the eagle, Shakespeare makes mention
of four&mdash;the Vulture, the Osprey, the Kite, and the
Buzzard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VULTURE:</div>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the repulsive habits of
the Vulture, led as he is by instinct to gorge on carrion,
will best understand the allusions to this bird which are to
be met with in the works of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>What more forcible expression can be found to indicate

<div class="sidenote">THE OSPREY:</div>

<p>The structure of the Osprey is wonderfully adapted to
his habits, and an examination of the feet of this bird will
prove how admirably contrived they are for grasping and
holding a slippery fish. Mr. St. John, who had excellent
opportunities of studying the Osprey in his native haunts,
says:<a id="Marker_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="marker">39</a>&mdash;“I generally saw the osprey fishing about the
lower pools of the rivers near their mouths; and a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" title="42"> </a><!--066.png-->
beautiful sight it is. The long-winged bird hovers (as a
kestrel does over a mouse), at a considerable distance
above the water, sometimes on perfectly motionless wing,
and sometimes, wheeling slowly in circles, turning his head
and looking eagerly down at the water. He sees a trout
when at a great height, and suddenly closing his wings,
drops like a shot bird into the water, often plunging completely
under, and at other times appearing scarcely to
touch the water, but seldom failing to rise again with a
good-sized fish in his talons. Sometimes, in the midst of
his swoop, the osprey stops himself suddenly in the most
abrupt manner, probably because the fish, having changed
its position, is no longer within range. He then hovers,
again stationary, in the air, anxiously looking below for
the re-appearance of the prey. Having well examined
one pool, he suddenly turns off, and with rapid flight
takes himself to an adjoining part of the stream, where
he again begins to hover and circle in the air. On
making a pounce into the water, the osprey dashes up
the spray far and wide, so as to be seen for a considerable
distance.”</p>

of Aufidius, who <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS POWER OVER FISH.</div>

<p>Mr. Staunton thinks that the image is founded on the
fabulous power attributed to the osprey of fascinating the
fish on which he preys. In Peele’s play of <i>The Battle of
Alcazar</i>, 1594 (Act i. Sc. 1), we <span class="no-wrap">read:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE KITE,</div>

<p>Another of the birds of prey mentioned by Shakespeare
is “the lazar Kite” (<i>Henry V.</i> Act ii. Sc. 1).
Although a large bird, and called by some the royal
Kite (<i>Milvus regalis</i>), it has not the bold dash of many
of our smaller hawks in seizing live and strong prey, but
glides about ignobly, looking for a sickly or wounded
victim, or for offal of any sort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HABITS OF THE KITE.</div>

<p>The habit which the kite has, in common with other
rapacious birds, of rejecting or disgorging the undigested
portions of its food, such as bones and fur, in the shape of
pellets, was apparently well known to Shakespeare, for
he <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE KITE’S NEST.</div>

<p>Another curious fact in the natural history of the kite
is adverted to in the <i>Winter’s Tale</i> (Act iv. Sc. 2). It is
there <span class="no-wrap">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“When the kite builds, look to lesser linen.”</div>
</div>

<p>This line may be perhaps best illustrated by giving a
description of a kite’s nest which we have seen, and which
was taken many years ago in Huntingdonshire. The
outside of the nest was composed of strong sticks; the
lining consisted of small pieces of linen, part of a saddle-girth,
a bit of a harvest glove, part of a straw bonnet,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" title="47"> </a><!--071.png-->
pieces of paper, and a worsted garter. In the midst of
this singular collection of materials were deposited two
eggs. The kite is now almost extinct in England, and a
kite’s nest, of course, is a great rarity. The Rev. H.&nbsp;B.
Tristram, speaking of the habits of the Egyptian kite
(<i>Milvus Ægyptius</i>), says:<a id="Marker_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="marker">40</a>&mdash;“Its nest, the marine store-shop
of the desert, is decorated with whatever scraps of
bournouses and coloured rags can be collected; and to
these are added, on every surrounding branch, the cast-off
coats of serpents, large scraps of thin bark, and perhaps
a bustard’s wing.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BUZZARD.</div>

<p>We have alluded to the Buzzard (<i>Buteo vulgaris</i>) in the
passage above quoted from <i>Richard III.</i>, and also to the
synonym “puttock,” which was sometimes applied to this
bird, as well as to the kite.</p>

<p>Mr. St. John, who was well acquainted with the common
buzzard, thought that in all its habits it more nearly
resembled the eagle than any other kind of hawk.<a id="Marker_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="marker">41</a></p>

<p>In the following passage, it seems probable, as suggested
by Mr. Staunton, that a play upon the words is intended,
and that “buzzard” in the second line means a beetle, so
called from its buzzing <span class="no-wrap">noise:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="48"> </a><!--072.png-->

<p>Neither the kite nor the buzzard were ever trained for
hawking, being deficient both in speed and pluck.</p>

<p>The former, however, was occasionally “flown at” by
falconers, although oftener for want of a better bird, than
because he showed much sport.</p>

<p>Both are now far less common than in Shakespeare’s
day. The increased number of shooters, and the war of
extermination which is carried on by gamekeepers,
inevitably seal their doom.</p>

<span class="smaller">HAWKS AND HAWKING.</span></h2>

<p>TO those who have ever taken part in a hawking
excursion, it must be a matter of some surprise
that so delightful a pastime has ceased to be popular.
Yet, at the present day, perhaps not one person in
five hundred has ever seen a trained hawk flown. In
Shakespeare’s time things were very different. Every
one who could afford it kept a hawk, and the rank
of the owner was indicated by the species of bird which
he carried. To a king belonged the gerfalcon; to a
prince, the falcon gentle; to an earl, the peregrine; to
a lady, the merlin; to a young squire, the hobby; while
a yeoman carried a goshawk; a priest, a sparrowhawk;
and a knave, or servant, a kestrel. But the sport was
attended with great expense, and much time and attention
were required of the falconer before his birds were perfectly
trained, and he himself a proficient.</p>

<p>This, combined with the increased enclosure and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" title="50"> </a><!--074.png-->
cultivation of waste lands, has probably contributed as
much as anything to the decline of falconry in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AGE OF HAWKING.</div>

<p>During the age in which Shakespeare lived, the sport
was at its height, and it is, therefore, not surprising that
he has taken much notice of it in his works, and has

<p>Many of the incidents connected with Duncan’s death
are not to be found in the narrative of that event, but are
taken from the chronicler’s account of King Duffe’s
murder. Among the prodigies there mentioned is the one
referred to by Shakespeare. “Monstrous sightes also,
that were seene without the Scottishe kingdome that year,
were these.… There was a sparhauke also
strangled by an owle.” We have known a Tawny Owl
to kill and devour a Kestrel which had been kept in the
same aviary with it.</p>

<p>By “tow’ring in her pride of place,” is here understood
to mean circling at her highest point of elevation. So in
Massinger’s play of <i>The Guardian</i>, Act i. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 2:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>By the falcon is always understood the female, as
distinguished from the tercel, or male, of the peregrine or
goshawk. The latter was probably called the tercel, or
tiercel, from being about <i>a third</i> smaller than the falcon.
Some authorities, however, state that of the three young
birds usually found in the nest of a falcon, two of them are
females and <i>the third</i> a male; hence the name of tercel.<a id="Marker_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="marker">43</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" title="53"> </a><!--077.png-->

<div class="sidenote">THE TERCEL-GENTLE.</div>

<p>By others, again, the term is supposed to have been
derived from the French <i>gentil</i>, meaning neat or handsome,
because of the beauty of its form.</p>

<p>There appears to be a great deal of confusion in the
nomenclature of the hawks used in falconry. The same
name has been applied to two distinct species, and the
same species, in different states of plumage, has received
two or more names. With regard to the “tercel,” as
distinguished from the “tercel-gentle,” it would appear
that the former name was given to the male goshawk, and
the latter to the male peregrine; for the peregrine being a
long-winged hawk, and the more <i>noble</i> of the two, the
word “gentle,” or “gentil,” was applied to it with that
signification.</p>

<p>In this view we are supported to some extent by quaint
old Izaak Walton. In his “Compleat Angler,” there is
an animated conversation between an angler, a hunter,
and a falconer, each of whom in turn commends his own
recreation. The falconer gives a list of his hawks, and
divides them into two classes, viz.: the long-winged and
short-winged hawks. In enumerating each species in
pairs, he gives first the name of the female, and then that
of the male: among the first class we <span class="no-wrap">find&mdash;</span></p>

a short-winged hawk.</p>

To understand the allusion to the falconer’s voice, it
should be observed that after a hawk had been flown, and
had either struck or missed the object of her pursuit, the
“lure” (which we shall presently describe) was thrown up
to entice her back, and at the same time the falconer
shouted to attract her attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUALITIES OF A GOOD FALCONER.</div>

<p>Professor Schneider, in a Latin volume published at
Leipsic, in 1788,<a id="Marker_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="marker">46</a> thus enumerates the qualities of a good
falconer: “Sit mediocris staturæ; sit perfecti ingenii;
bonæ memoriæ; levis auditu; acuti visûs; <i>homo magnæ

<div class="attribution"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act i. Sc. 5.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE LURE AND ITS USE.</div>

<p>The “lure” was of various shapes, and consisted merely
of a piece of iron or wood, generally in the shape of a
heart or horseshoe, to which were attached the wings of
some bird, with a piece of raw meat fixed between them.
A strong leathern strap, about three feet long, fastened to
it with a swivel, enabled the falconer to swing it round his
head, or throw it to a distance. With high-flying hawks,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_56" title="56"> </a><!--080.png-->
however, it was often found necessary to use a live pigeon,
secured to a string by soft leather jesses, in order to recall
them.<a id="Marker_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="marker">47</a></p>

<p>The long-winged hawks were always brought to the
lure, the short-winged ones to the <span class="no-wrap">hand:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line quote">“As falcon to the lure, away she flies.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Venus and Adonis.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The game flown at was called in hawking parlance the
“quarry,” and differed according to the hawk that was
used. The gerfalcon and peregrine were flown at herons,
ducks, pigeons, rooks, and magpies; the goshawk was
used for hares and partridges; while the smaller kinds,
such as the merlin and hobby, were trained to take blackbirds,
larks, and snipe. The French falconers, however, do
not appear to have been so <span class="no-wrap">particular:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" title="57"> </a><!--081.png-->

<p>In the language of the forest, “quarry” also meant a

Sc. 1), Caius Marcius <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>By “haggard” is meant a wild-caught and unreclaimed
mature hawk, as distinguished from an “eyess,” or nestling;
that is, a young hawk taken from the “eyrie” or
nest.</p>

<p>By some falconers “haggards” were also called “passage
hawks,” from being always caught when in that state,
at the time of their periodical passage or migration. As
will be seen hereafter, the word “haggard” occurs frequently
throughout the Plays.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAWK’S TRAPPINGS.</div>

<p>The “jesses” were two narrow strips of leather, fastened
one to each leg, the other ends being attached to a swivel,
from which depended the “leash.” When the hawk was
flown, the swivel and leash were taken off, the jesses and
bells remaining on the bird.</p>

<div class="img-center" id="pg58">

<div class="enlarge"><a href="images/pg58-large.jpg">View larger image.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the old falconers’ directions on these points
are very quaint. Turbervile, in his “Book of Falconrie,”
1575, speaking of the trappings of a hawk, says:&mdash;“Shee
must haue jesses of leather, the which must haue knottes
at the ende, and they should be halfe a foote long, or
there about; at the least a shaftmeete betweene the
hoose of the jesse, and the knotte at the ende, whereby
you tye the hauke.”</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" title="59"> </a><!--083.png-->

<div class="sidenote">THE JESSES.</div>

<p>In the modern “jesse,” however, there are no knots. It
is fastened in this wise. The leg of the hawk is placed
against the “jesse,” between the slits <span class="smaller">A</span> and <span class="smaller">B</span>. The end <span class="smaller">A</span>
is then passed through the slit <span class="smaller">B</span>, and the end <span class="smaller">C</span> in turn
through the slit <span class="smaller">A</span>. The swivel, with its dependent leash, is
then attached to slit <span class="smaller">C</span>; and the same with the other leg.</p>

<p>Othello <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“I’d whistle her off, and let her down the wind,</div>
<div class="line">To prey at fortune.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Falconers always flew their hawk <i>against</i> the wind. If
flown <i>down</i> the wind, she seldom returned. When, therefore,
a useless bird was to be dismissed, her owner flew
her “down the wind;” and thenceforth she shifted for herself,
and was said “to prey at fortune.”</p>

<p>The word “haggard,” as before observed, is of frequent
occurrence throughout the Plays of Shakespeare. In the
<i>Taming of the Shrew</i> (Act iv. Sc. 2), Hortensio speaks of
Bianca as “this proud disdainful <i>haggard</i>.” In <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i> (Act iii. Sc. 1), Hero, alluding to Beatrice,
<span class="no-wrap">says&mdash;</span></p>

“fly at,” although it sometimes meant to “change the bird

<p>Besides the “jesses,” the “bells” formed an indispensable
part of a hawk’s trappings. These were of circular
form, from a quarter to a full inch in diameter, and made
of brass or silver, and were attached, one to each leg of
the bird, by means of small slips of leather called
“bewits.” The use of bells was to lead the falconer by
their sound to the hawk when in a wood, or out of
sight.</p>

<p>The allusion is to the ordinary action of a hawk, which,

<div class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE WORD “MEW.”</div>

<p>The word “mew,” derived from the old French “<i>mue</i>,”
signifies a change, or moult, when birds and other animals
cast their feathers, hair, or horns. Hence Latham
observes that “the mew is that place, whether it be
abroad or in the house, where you set down your
hawk during the time she raiseth or reproduceth her
feathers.”</p>

<p>It was necessary to take great care of a hawk in her
mewing time. In “The Gentleman’s Academie,” edited
by Gervase Markham, 1595, there are several sections on
the mewing of hawks, from one of which it may be learnt
that the best time to commence is in the beginning of
Lent; and if well kept, the bird will be mewed, that is,
moulted, by the beginning of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROYAL MEWS.</div>

<p>The Royal hawks were kept at the mews at Charing
Cross during many reigns (according to Stowe, from the
time of Richard II., in 1377), but they were removed by
Henry VIII., who converted the place into stables. The
name, however, confirmed by the usage of so long a period,
remained to the building, although, after the hawks were
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" title="66"> </a><!--090.png-->
withdrawn, it became inapplicable. But, what is more
curious still, in later times, when the people of London
began to build ranges of stabling at the back of their
streets and houses, they christened those places “mews,”
after the old stabling at Charing Cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FOWL ENMEWED.</div>

<p>The word “enmew,” quoted above in the passage from
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, would seem rather to signify here,
“to seize upon,” or “to disable.” It is sometimes written
“enewe.” In Nash’s “Quaternio; or, a Fourefold Way
to a Happie Life,” published in 1633, it occurs in a
spirited description of hawking at water-fowl:&mdash;“And to
hear an accipitary relate againe how he went forth in a
cleare, calme, and sunshine evening, about an houre before
the sunne did usually maske himselfe, unto the river,
where finding of a mallard, he whistled off<a id="Marker_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="marker">51</a> his falcon,
and how shee flew from him as if shee would never have
turned head againe, yet presently upon a shoote came in;
how then by degrees, by little and little, by flying about
and about, shee mounted so high, until shee had lessened
herselfe to the view of the beholder to the shape of a
pigeon or partridge, and had made the height of the moon
the place<a id="Marker_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="marker">52</a> of her flight; how presently, upon the landing
of the fowle, shee came downe like a stone and <i>enewed</i> it,
and suddenly got up againe, and suddenly upon a second
landing came down againe, and missing of it, in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" title="67"> </a><!--091.png-->
downe course recovered it beyond expectation, to the
admiration of the beholder at a long flight.”</p>

<p>Another method of spelling the same word may be
instanced by the following quotation from Turbervile’s
“Book of Falconrie,” <span class="no-wrap">1575:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“And if shee misse, to mark her how shee then gets up amaine,</div>

<div class="sidenote">IMPING.</div>

<p>In the days of falconry<a id="Marker_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="marker">53</a> a peculiar method of repairing
a broken wing-feather was known to falconers by the
term “imping.” The verb “to imp,” appears to be derived
from the Anglo-Saxon “impan,” signifying to graft, or
inoculate; and the mode of operation is thus described in
a scarce pamphlet by Sir John Sebright, entitled “Observations
on <span class="no-wrap">Hawking”:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When any of the flight or tail-feathers of a hawk are
accidentally broken, the speed of the bird is so injured,
that the falconer finds it necessary to repair them by an
expedient called ‘imping.’</p>

<p>“This curious process consists in attaching to the part
that remains an exact substitute for the piece lost. For
this purpose the falconer is always provided with pinions
(right and left) and with tail-feathers of hawks, or with
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" title="68"> </a><!--092.png-->
the feathers separated from the pinion carefully preserved
and numbered, so as to prevent mistake in taking a true
match for the injured feather. He then with a sharp
knife gently parts the web of the feather to be repaired at
its thickest part, and cuts the shaft obliquely forward, so
as not to damage the web on the opposite edge. He
next cuts the substitute feather as exactly as possible at
the corresponding point and with the same degree of
slope.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of uniting them, he is provided with
an iron needle with broad angular points at both ends,
and after wetting the needle with salt-and-water, he
thrusts it into the centre of the pith of each part, as
truly straight and as nearly to the same length in each
as may be.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="img-center" id="pg68">
<img src="images/pg68.jpg" width="400" height="74" alt="Imping" />
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>“When this operation has been skilfully performed,
the junction is so neat, that an inexperienced eye would
hardly discern the point of union, and as the iron rusts
from having been wetted with brine, there is little or no
danger of separation.”</p>

<p>Passages such as this are likely enough to be overlooked
by the majority of readers, but it is in such chiefly that
the ornithologist sees a proof that Shakespeare, for the
age in which he lived, possessed a surprising knowledge of
ornithology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEELING.</div>

<p>Besides “imping,” there was another practice in use,
now happily obsolete, termed “seeling,” to which we find
several allusions in the Plays. It consisted in sewing a
thread through the upper and under eyelids of a newly-caught
hawk, to obscure the sight for a time, and accustom
her to the hood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO SEEL A HAWK.</div>

<p>Turbervile, in his “Book of Falconrie,” 1575, gives the
following quaint directions “how to seele a hawke”:&mdash;“Take
a needle threeded with untwisted thread, and
(casting your Hawke) take her by the beake, and put the
needle through her eye-lidde, not right against the sight of
the eye, but somewhat nearer to the beake, because she
may see backwards. And you must take good heede that
you hurt not the webbe, which is under the eye-lidde, or
on the inside thereof. Then put your needle also through
that other eye-lidde, drawing the endes of the thread
together, tye them over the beake, not with a straight
knotte, but cut off the threedes endes neare to the knotte,
and twist them together in such sorte, that the eye-liddes
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" title="70"> </a><!--094.png-->
may be raysed so upwards, that the Hawke may not see
at all, and when the threed shall ware loose or untyed,
then the Hawke may see somewhat backwardes, which is
the cause that the threed is put nearer to the beake. For
a Sparrow-hawke should see somewhat backwardes, and a
Falcon forwardes. The reasõ is that if the Sparrow-hawke
should see forwardes, shee would beate off her
feathers, or break them when she bateth upon the fist, and
seeing the companie of men, or such like, she would bate
too much.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the last line it is more probable, considering the use
of the technical term “seel,” above explained, that Shakespeare
wrote “close as hawk’s.”</p>

<p>Sir Emerson Tennant, in his “Sketches of the Natural
History of Ceylon,” speaking of the goshawk (p. 246),
says:&mdash;“In the district of Anarajapoora, where it is
trained for hawking, it is usual, in lieu of a hood, to
darken its eyes by means of a silken thread passed
through holes in the eyelids.” This practice of “seeling”
appears to be of some antiquity, but has happily given way,
to a great extent, to the more merciful use of the hood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUAINT RECIPES.</div>

<p>The old treatises on falconry contain numerous quaint
recipes for the various ailments to which hawks are
subject. From one of these we learn that petroleum is
nothing new, as some people now-a-days would have us
believe. Turbervile, writing in 1575, says, in his “Booke
of Falconrie”:&mdash;“An other approued medecine is to
annoint the swelling of your hawkes foot with <i>Oleum
petrœlium</i> (which is the oyle of a rocke) and with oyle of
white Lillies, taking of each of these like quantity, the
blood of a pigeon, and the tallow of a candle, heating
all these together a little at the fire. This unguent wil
throughly resolue the mischief.”&mdash;P. 258.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" title="72"> </a><!--096.png-->

<div class="sidenote">GOING A-BIRDING.</div>

<p>Hawking was sometimes called “birding.” In the <i>Merry
Wives of Windsor</i> (Act iii. Sc. 3), Master Page <span class="no-wrap">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house to
breakfast; after, we’ll <i>a-birding</i> together; I have a fine
hawk for the bush.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was probably a goshawk, for, being a short-winged
hawk and of slower flight, this species was considered the
best for a woody district, or, as Shakespeare terms it, “the
bush.”</p>

<p>In the same play (Act iii. Sc. 5) Dame Quickly, referring
to Mistress Ford, says,&mdash;“Her husband goes this
morning <i>a-birding;</i>” and Mistress Ford, herself, says (Act
iv. Sc. 2),&mdash;“He’s <i>a-birding</i>, sweet Sir John.”</p>

<p>But it seems that birding was not always synonymous
with hawking, for, later on in the last-mentioned scene,
we read as <span class="no-wrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<i class="speaker">Falstaff.</i> What shall I do? I’ll creep up into the
chimney.</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Mrs. Ford.</i> There they always use to discharge their
<i>birding-pieces</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KESTREL.</div>

<p>In two instances only does Shakespeare allude to a
particular species of hawk. These are the Kestrel and
Sparrowhawk.</p>

<p>When Malvolio, in <i>Twelfth Night</i> (Act ii. Sc. 5), finds
the letter which Maria has purposely dropt in his path,
Sir Toby Belch, looking on from ambush, exclaims, in
sporting <span class="no-wrap">terms:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“And with what wing the <i>stanniel</i> checks at it!”</div>
</div>

<p>Here <i>stanniel</i> is a corruption of <i>standgale</i>, a name for
the kestrel hawk, and Malvolio is said to “check at” the
letter, just as a kestrel hovers over a mouse or other
object which has suddenly attracted its attention.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" title="74"> </a><!--098.png-->

<p>It is true that the reading of the folios here is <i>stallion;</i>
but the word <i>wing</i>, and the falconers’ term <i>checks</i>, abundantly
prove that a bird must be meant. Sir Thomas
Hanmer, therefore, proposed this correction, which all
subsequent editors have received as justifiable.</p>

<p>The origin of the word “kestrel” is somewhat uncertain.
By some it is derived from “coystril,” a knave
or peasant, from being the hawk formerly used by persons
of inferior rank, as we learn from Dame Juliana Berners,
in her “Boke of St. Albans.” This opinion is strengthened
by the reading “coystril,” in <i>Twelfth Night</i> (Act i.
Sc. 3), and “coistrel,” in <i>Pericles</i> (Act iv. Sc. 6). A
different spelling again occurs in “The Gentleman’s
Recreation,” by Ric. Blome (folio, London, 1686), where
the word is written “castrell.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SPARROWHAWK.</div>

<p>The sparrowhawk is only mentioned once by Shakespeare,
and the passage is one which might be very
easily overlooked by any one not conversant with the
language of falconry. In the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
Mrs. Ford addresses Falstaff’s page <span class="no-wrap">with&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“How now, my <i>eyas-musket?</i>”</div>
</div>

<p>“Musket”<a id="Marker_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="marker">54</a> was the name given by the falconers of old
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" title="75"> </a><!--099.png-->
to the male sparrowhawk; “eyas” or “eyess,” as before
explained, signifying a nestling, or young bird from the
eyrie or nest. In the above speech, Mrs. Ford probably
intended to imply no more than we should now-a-days
mean by the expression “a perky little fellow.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAWK AND HERNSHAW.</div>

<p>The words of Hamlet with reference to a hawk must be
familiar to all readers of Shakespeare, the more so,
possibly, because the passage in question appears to have
puzzled many <span class="no-wrap">commentators:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
southerly, I know a <i>hawk</i> from a <i>handsaw</i>.”</p>

<div class="attribution right"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The explanation is simple enough. The last word
should be “hernshaw,” the old name for the heron. It is
not every one who knows a hawk from a heron when he
sees it, although it is scarcely possible to conceive two
birds more unlike in appearance. Hamlet’s statement,
then, is simply to the effect that he only feigned madness
when it suited his purpose; at other times he could even
outwit the many, and see a distinction where they, from
ignorance, would fail.</p>

<p>The ingenuity which has been exercised in a laudable
endeavour to interpret this passage is really surprising.
“An ingenious friend,” says the <i>Athenæum</i>,<a id="Marker_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="marker">55</a> “suggests
the following explanation:&mdash;‘Among the ancient Ægyptians,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_76" title="76"> </a><!--100.png-->
the hawk signified the Etesian, or northerly wind
(which, in the beginning of summer, drives the vapour
towards the south, and which, covering Ethiopia with
dense clouds, there resolves them into rains, causing the
Nile to swell), because that bird follows the direction
of that wind (Job xxxix. 26). The heron, hern, or hernshaw
signified the southerly wind, because it takes its flight
from Ethiopia into Upper Egypt, following the course of
the Nile as it retires within its banks, and living on the
small worms hatched in the mud of the river. Hence the
heads of these two birds may be seen surmounting the
<i>canopi</i> used by the ancient<!--TN: ancent in original--> Ægyptians to indicate the rising
and falling of the Nile respectively. Now Hamlet, though
feigning madness, yet claims sufficient sanity to distinguish
a hawk from a hernshaw when the wind is southerly; that
is, in the time of the migration of the latter to the north,
and when the former is not to be seen. Shakespeare may
have become acquainted with the habits of these migrating
birds of Egypt through a translation of Plutarch, who
gives a particular account of them, published in the middle
of the sixteenth century by Thomas North.’”</p>

<p>We cannot peruse them without being carried back, in
spirit, to an age in which, for all that concerns sport, we

<span class="smaller">THE OWL AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS.</span></h2>


<p>AS Jove assumed the shape of an Eagle, so Juno selected
that of an Owl, for, as Aldrovandus tells us, it was not
decorous that the queen of heaven should take on herself
the likeness of any small or vulgar bird, but rather that
she should be embodied in one whose reign by night was
equal with that of the eagle by day. The owl has usually
been regarded as a bird of ill omen, and superstitiously
considered a messenger of woe. The Athenians alone
among the ancients seem to have been free from this
popular prejudice, and to have regarded the owl with
veneration rather than abhorrence, considering it as the
favourite of Minerva, and the image of wisdom. The
Romans viewed the owl with detestation and dread. By
them it was held sacred to Proserpine: its appearance
foreboded unfortunate events, and, according to Pliny, the
city of Rome underwent a solemn lustration in consequence
of an owl having accidentally strayed into the
Capitol.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_84" title="84"> </a><!--108.png-->

<div class="sidenote">ITS USE IN MEDICINE.</div>

<p>In the ancient pharmacopœia, which savoured not a
little of magic, the owl appears to have been “great medicine.”
Ovid tells us that this bird was used wholesale in
the composition of Medea’s <span class="no-wrap">gruel:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“Et strigis infames ipsis cum carnibus alas.”</div>

<p>The “owlet’s wing” was an ingredient of the cauldron
wherein the witches prepared their “charm of powerful
trouble” (<i>Macbeth</i>, Act iv. Sc. 1); and, with the character
assigned to it by the ancients, Shakespeare, no doubt, felt
that the introduction of an owl in a dreadful scene of a
tragedy would help to make the subject come home more
forcibly to the people, who had, from early times, associated
its presence with melancholy, misfortune, and
death. Accordingly, we find the unfortunate owl stigmatized
at various times as the “obscure,” “ominous,”
“fearful,” and “fatal” “bird of night.” Its doleful cry
pierces the ear of Lady Macbeth while the murder is
being <span class="no-wrap">done:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is curious how wide-spread is the superstition regarding
certain birds, and particularly the owl. Even amongst
the Land Dayaks of Borneo, the owl is considered a bird
of ill omen. Mr. Spenser St. John, in his “Life in the
Forests of the Far East,” observes with regard to omens
(vol. i. <span class="no-wrap">p. 202):&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If a man be going on a war expedition, and has a slip
during his first day’s journey, he must return to his village,
especially if by the accident blood be drawn, for then,
should he proceed, he has no prospect but wounds or
death. If the accident occur during a long expedition,
he must return to his last night’s resting place. In some
tribes, if a deer cry near a party who are setting out on
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_87" title="87"> </a><!--111.png-->
a journey, they will return. When going out at night to
the jungle, if the scream of a hawk, or an owl, or of a
small kind of frog be heard, it is a sign that sickness will
follow if the design be pursued; and again, if the screech
of the two former be heard in front of a party on the warpath,
it is an evil sign, and they must return. Omens
derived from the cry of birds are always sought previously
to setting out on a journey, and before fixing on a spot to
build new houses, or to prepare their farms.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">ITS UTILITY TO THE FARMER.</div>

<p>Far from bringing any ill-luck to our dwellings, owls
are really of the greatest service to us in destroying great
numbers of vermin. A Swiss naturalist, speaking of the
quantity of field-voles which are annually destroyed by
owls and buzzards, <span class="no-wrap">says:<a id="Marker_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="marker">56</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“C’est un fait curieux que l’homme s’acharne tout
particulièrement à detruire ses meillures amis, et qu’il
poursuive de ses malédictions les êtres qui le servent le
mieux. Je joindrai donc ma faible voix à celle de bien
d’autres naturalistes pour demander que l’on protége les
premières de ces bêtes.</p>

<p>“Les hibous et les chouettes, bien loin de jeter de
mauvais sorts sur nos demeures, prennent au contraire,
un grand soin de nos intérêts. Ces oiseaux exterminent,
en effet, bien plus de souris que n’en pourront prendre
jamais les meilleurs taupiers. Les buses n’ont nullement

plutôt que de les tuer, l’on ferait bien mieux d’établir
chez nous, comme cela s’est fait avec succès dans
certaines localités, de hauts perchoirs dans nos campagnes
pour attirer ces oiseaux bienfaisants.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">A CURIOUS TRADITION.</div>

<p>Among the many curious legends which exist with
reference to this bird, we may mention one to which
Shakespeare has alluded in <span class="no-wrap">Hamlet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“They say the owl was a baker’s daughter.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act iv. Sc. 5.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Staunton, in his edition of Shakespeare’s Plays, says
this has reference to a tradition still current in some parts
of England. “Our Saviour went into a baker’s shop where
they were baking, and asked for some bread to eat. The
mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough into
the oven to bake for him, but was reprimanded by her
daughter, who, insisting that the piece of dough was too
large, reduced it considerably in size. The dough,
however, immediately afterwards began to swell, and
presently became of an enormous size. Whereupon
the baker’s daughter cried out, ‘Wheugh! wheugh!
wheugh!’ which owl-like noise, it is said, probably
induced our Saviour, for her wickedness, to transform her
into that bird.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douce represents this story as still current amongst
the common people in Gloucestershire.<a id="Marker_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="marker">57</a> According to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" title="89"> </a><!--113.png-->
Nuttall, the north country nurses would have it that the
owl was a daughter of Pharaoh, and when they heard it
hoot on a winter’s night, they sang to the wondering <span class="no-wrap">child&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i20">                            “Oh! ŏ ŏ ŏ, ō ō;</div>
<div class="line">I once was a king’s daughter, and sat on my father’s knee,</div>
<div class="line">But now I’m a poor hoolet, and hide in a hollow tree.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is much difference of opinion amongst naturalists
as to whether the power of hooting and shrieking is
possessed by the same species. In the following passage
from <i>Julius Cæsar</i> (Act i. Sc. 3), both sounds are attributed
to the same <span class="no-wrap">bird:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i6">        “Yesterday the <i>bird of night</i> did sit,</div>
<div class="line">Even at noonday, upon the market-place,</div>
<div class="line">Hooting and shrieking.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is generally supposed that the common barn or white
owl does not hoot, but only shrieks, and is, in fact, the
bird always alluded to as the “screech-owl,” while the
brown owls (<i>Strix otus</i>, <i>brachyotus</i>, and <i>aluco</i>) are the
<span class="no-wrap">hooters&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>But Mr. Colquhoun, speaking of the white or barn owl,
says,<a id="Marker_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="marker">58</a> “It does hoot, but very rarely. I heard one six
times in succession, and then it ceased.” Sir William
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_90" title="90"> </a><!--114.png-->
Jardine once shot a white owl in the act of hooting;
and Mr. Boulton, of Beverley, Yorkshire, describes<a id="Marker_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="marker">59</a> the
note of one of these birds which he had reared from
the nest, and kept in confinement for fifteen months,
as follows:&mdash;“It does hoot exactly like the long-eared
owl, but not so frequently. I use the term ‘hoot’ in
contradistinction to ‘screech,’ which it often does when
irritated.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOTE OF THE OWL.</div>

<p>In Gardiner’s “Music of Nature” the note of the brown
owl is thus <span class="no-wrap">rendered:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="img-center">
<img src="images/pg90.png" width="422" height="55" alt="Music" />
<div class="music">[<a href="music/pg90.mid">MIDI</a>]</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Colquhoun, to whom allusion has just been made,
says, that the music of the white or barn owl is a little
different from that of the brown owls. It is only one
prolonged cadence, lower and not so mournful as that of
the tawny fellow.</p>

<p>It would appear that owls do not keep to one note. A
friend of Gilbert White’s remarked that most of his owls
hooted in B flat, but that one went almost half a note
below A. The pipe by which he tried their notes was a
common half-crown pitchpipe. A neighbour, also, of the
Selborne naturalist, who was said to have a nice ear,
remarked that the owls about Selborne hooted in three
different keys: in G flat (or F sharp), in B flat, and A
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_91" title="91"> </a><!--115.png-->
flat. He heard two hooting to each other, the one in
A flat, the other in B flat.</p>

<p>It did not appear, however, whether the sounds proceeded
from different species of brown owls, or from
different individuals of the same species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OWL ROBBING NESTS.</div>

<p>Another question in the life-history of the owl is
raised by the following passage from <i>Macbeth</i> (Act iv.
<span class="no-wrap">Sc. 2):&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i16">                    “For the poor wren,</div>
<div class="line">The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</div>
<div class="line">Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This defence of their young by birds has often been
noticed by <span class="no-wrap">Shakespeare:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</div>
<div class="line">And though man’s face be fearful to their eyes,</div>
<div class="line">Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</div>
<div class="line">Who hath not seen them (even with those wings</div>
<div class="line">Which sometimes they have us’d with fearful flight)</div>
<div class="line">Make war with him that climb’d unto their nest,</div>

<div class="sidenote">EVIDENCE NOT CONCLUSIVE.</div>

<p>We are not aware, however, that an owl has ever been
caught in the act of robbing a nest, and, indeed, it would not
be easy to detect him, from the fact of his preying by night.
Nevertheless, there is presumptive evidence to support
the charge. A writer in <i>The Field</i>, of 29th June, 1867,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_92" title="92"> </a><!--116.png-->
says:&mdash;“Standing in my garden in Bedford Park,
Croydon, an evening or two since, I saw a white owl fly
to a sparrow’s nest lodged on a water-spout under the
roof of the house, and as though that visit was not
successful, he repeated it, and then went to a nest on the
next house, in the same way. It was too dark for me to
see if he succeeded in his marauding expedition against
the poor sparrows. Is it a common occurrence for an owl
to go robbing nests? I never saw it done before, though
I have lived all my life in the country, and of course seen
this favourite bird skimming over the water meadows for
its supper.” To this communication the editor adds the
following note:&mdash;“This fact is extremely interesting, and,
we think, generally unknown. It would, however, have
added much to the interest, had the robbery actually
been proved; it does not seem quite certain that this
was the owl’s object in visiting the roof.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS CHARACTER MALIGNED.</div>

<p>Some years ago, having made the discovery that some
stock-doves were building in the wooden spire of our
village church, we commissioned the parish clerk to secure
a pair of young birds as soon as they were ready
to fly. He made several attempts for this purpose,
paying occasional visits to see how the young birds were
getting on, when, on going to the nest, as he supposed for
the last time, to carry them off, he found it empty. This
happened three or four times, and he was much puzzled
to account for it. The birds could not have flown&mdash;they
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_93" title="93"> </a><!--117.png-->
were not old enough. No one else could have taken them,
for the church could not be entered without the key, which
he always kept. Had rats carried them off? The clerk
said there were none. Had there been any, he must have
heard or seen them on one or other of his many visits to
the church, or at least have found signs of their presence.
But this was never the case. He stated, however, that a
pair of barn owls lived in the same spire, and he thought
that they were the culprits, taking the young ones, as he
said, as soon as they were fat enough, to save themselves
the trouble of hunting out of doors. Be this as it may,
we feel bound to say, on behalf of the owls, they were
never caught in the fact, and that the parent stock-doves
were not deterred from laying again and again, and at
length rearing a brood. Charles Waterton, whose name
will be familiar to all naturalists, argues strongly against
the notion of the barn owl robbing dove-cotes. He
says<a id="Marker_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="marker">60</a>:&mdash;“When farmers complain that the barn owl
destroys the eggs of their pigeons, they lay the saddle on
the wrong horse. They ought to put it on the rat.</p>

<p>“Formerly, I could get very few young pigeons till the
rats were excluded effectually from the dove-cot. Since
that took place, it has produced a great abundance every
year, though the barn owls frequent it, and are encouraged
all around it. The barn owl merely resorts to it for
repose and concealment. If it were really an enemy to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_94" title="94"> </a><!--118.png-->
the dove-cot, we should see the pigeons in commotion as
soon as it begins its evening flight, but the pigeons heed
it not; whereas if the sparrowhawk or hobby should
make its appearance, the whole community would be up
at once&mdash;proof sufficient that the barn owl is not looked
upon as a bad or even a suspicious character by the
inhabitants of the dove-cot.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS FIVE WITS.</div>

<p>Why the owl has been called the “bird of wisdom” it
is not easy to determine. Possibly because it can see in
the dark, and is the only bird which looks straightforward.

appetites of the ‘five wittes;’ as sight, hereing, smelling,

<p>It is not to be supposed that Shakespeare was always
a firm believer in the popular notions respecting animals
and birds to which he has made allusion. In many cases
he had a particular motive in introducing such notions,
although possibly aware of their erroneous nature, and he
evidently adopted them only to impart an air of reality to
the scenes which he depicted, and to bring them home
more forcibly to the impressionable minds of his auditors,
to whom such “folks-lore” would be familiar. This is
notably the case as regards the owl, and no one can read
the first scene in the second act of <i>Macbeth</i>, or the
fourth scene in the first act of <i>Henry VI.</i> (Part II.),

<span class="smaller">THE CROWS AND THEIR RELATIONS.</span></h2>


<p>TO a superficial observer of nature, there may appear
to be a much greater resemblance between the Raven,
the Crow, the Rook, and the Jackdaw, than we find to be
actually the case. At the same time, so different to them
in outward appearance are the Jay and Magpie, that it
may appear extraordinary to class them all together.
Nevertheless, while each, of course, has its distinguishing
characters, all are included in the first section of the
family of crows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RAVEN,</div>

<p>The Raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>), from his size and character,
naturally takes the lead. Go where we will over the face of
the wide world, the well-known hoarse croak of the raven is
still to be heard. He was seen perched on the bare rocks,
looking over the dreary snows of the highest points visited
in the Arctic Expeditions. Under the burning sun of
the equator he enjoys his feast of carrion. He was discovered
in the islands of the Pacific Ocean by Captain
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_100" title="100"> </a><!--124.png-->
Cook; and in the lowest Southern or Antarctic regions,
other travellers have found him pursuing his cautious
predatory life, just as in England.<a id="Marker_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="marker">61</a></p>

<p>From the earliest times the raven, with his deep and
solemn voice, has always commanded attention, and
superstitious people have become impressed with the idea
that there is something unearthly in his nature and
ominous in his voice.<a id="Marker_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="marker">62</a> By the Romans this bird was
consecrated to Apollo, and regarded as a foreteller of
good or evil. Through a long course of centuries this
character has clung to him; and even to this day, there
are many who believe that the raven’s croak predicts a
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BIRD OF ILL OMEN.</div>

<p>No wonder, then, that Shakespeare has taken advantage
of this wide-spread belief, and has introduced the raven
into many of the solemn passages of his Plays, to carry
conviction to the minds of the people, and render his
images the more impressive. He frequently alludes to
“the ill-boding raven:”</p>

<p>After Balthazar has sung his well-known song, “Sigh no

God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have
heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come

<div class="sidenote">THE NIGHT-CROW:</div>

<p>Willughby thought that the so-called “night-raven”
was the bittern. Speaking of the curious noise produced
by the latter bird, he says:&mdash;“This, I suppose, is the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_102" title="102"> </a><!--126.png-->
bird which the vulgar call the night-raven, and have a
great dread of.”<a id="Marker_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="marker">63</a></p>

<p>The bittern was one of the very few birds which Goldsmith,
in his “Animated Nature,” described from personal
observation, and he, too, calls it the “night-raven.” Its
hollow boom, he says, caused it to be held in detestation
by the vulgar. “I remember, in the place where I was
a boy, with what terror the bird’s note affected the whole
village; they considered it as the presage of some sad event,
and generally found, or made one to succeed it. If any
person in the neighbourhood died, they supposed it could
not be otherwise, for the night-raven had foretold it; but
if nobody happened to die, the death of a cow or a sheep
gave completion to the prophecy.”</p>

<p>It is most probable that the supposed prophetic
power of the raven, respecting battles and bloodshed,
originated in its frequent presence on these occasions,
drawn to the field of slaughter by an attractive banquet
of unburied bodies of the slain. Hence poets have
described this bird as possessing a mysterious knowledge
of these things. The Icelanders, notwithstanding their
endeavours to destroy as many as they can, yet give
them credit for the gift of prophecy, and have a high
opinion of them as soothsayers. And the priests of the

<div class="sidenote">ALLEGED DESERTION OF YOUNG.</div>

<p>It would appear, from some passages in the sacred
Scriptures, that the desertion of their young had not
escaped the observation of the inspired writers. It was
certainly a current belief in olden times, that when the
raven saw its young ones newly hatched, and covered
with down, it conceived such an aversion that it forsook
them, and did not return to the nest until a darker
plumage had shown itself. And to this belief commentators
suppose the Psalmist alludes when he says:&mdash;“<i>He
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_106" title="106"> </a><!--130.png-->
giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
cry</i>.” (Psalm cxlvii. 9.) And again, in Job, “<i>Who provideth
for the raven his food? When his young ones cry
unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</i>” (Job xxxviii. 41.)</p>

<p>In Batman “upon Bartholome his book, ‘De proprietatibus
Rerum,’ folio, 1582,” we find the following passage
bearing upon the question:&mdash;“The raven is called <i>Corvus</i>
of Corax. It is said that ravens birdes (<i>i.e.</i>, young ravens)
be fed with deaw of heaven all the time that they have
no black feathers by benefite of age.” (Lib. xii. c. 10.)</p>

<p>Izaak Walton, in his “Compleat Angler,” speaking of
fish without mouths, which “are nourished and take
breath by the porousness of their gills, man knows not
how,” observes that “this may be believed if we consider

takes no further care, but leaves her young ones to the

<div class="sidenote">VARIATION IN COLOUR.</div>

<p>We have seen a variety of the jackdaw of a dirty
yellowish-white colour; it could scarcely be called “amber-colour’d.”
No doubt other members of the genus <i>Corvus</i>
have occasionally been observed to vary quite as much in
their plumage. Shakespeare <span class="no-wrap">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>No doubt it was; quite as much as a white blackbird.
This apparent contradiction of terms is in reality no myth.
We have seen three or four albino varieties of the blackbird,
and could give a tolerably long list of dark-plumaged
birds of which pure white, or almost pure white, varieties
have been found. This may be the result of disease, or
of old age, drying up the animal secretions, and causing
the absence of colour which we call white. According to
ancient authors, ravens were formerly white, but were
changed to black for babbling. The great age to which the
raven sometimes attains has been alluded to in the first
chapter, where some reference is made to “ancient” eagles,
and tame ravens have been known to outlive several
masters who owned them successively. But birds, like all
things else, succumb to time. Shakespeare tells <span class="no-wrap">us,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Like him, he leads a predatory life, carrying off young

<div class="sidenote">THE CHOUGH.</div>

<p>Associated with the crow by many of the poets is the
Red-legged Crow, or Chough&mdash;the Cornish Chough, as it
is sometimes called, from its being considered a bird
peculiar to the south-west coast of England. Since this
last name was applied to it, the study of ornithology has
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_116" title="116"> </a><!--140.png-->
become so universally courted, that it can scarcely be
necessary to show that the geographical distribution of
the species is much wider than was formerly supposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHOUGH AND CROW.</div>

<p>The old song of “The Chough and Crow” will probably
be remembered as long as the English language lasts.</p>

<p>Shakespeare has introduced both these birds in a fine
description of Dover Cliff. It is not improbable that
the chough, which affects precipices and sea-cliffs, may
once have frequented the cliffs at Dover; but whatever
may have been the case formerly, this haunt, if it ever was
one, has long since been deserted. Shakespeare, at all
events, has placed this bird in a situation most natural
to <span class="no-wrap">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The chough is easily tamed, and a prettier sight than
three or four of these birds, with their bright red legs and

conceived.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the species is not more

<div class="sidenote">THE JACKDAW.</div>

<p>The word “chough,” it appears, was not always

we may infer from the following passage in O’Flaherty’s
“West or H’Iar Connaught, 1684,” p. 13:&mdash;“I omit other

cocks-of-the-wood, woodcocks, <i>choughs</i>, rooks, <i>Cornish

<p>Now the jackdaw, though having a grey head, would
more appropriately bear the designation of “russet-pated”

that this is the species to which Shakespeare intended

body, is perfectly black.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MAGPIE.</div>

<p>With the ancients, much superstition prevailed in regard
to various species of the crow family; and Shakespeare has
specially mentioned three of these as birds of <span class="no-wrap">omen:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Augurs that understood relations have,</div>

<div class="attribution"><i>Macbeth</i>, Act iii. Sc. 4.</div>
</div>

<p>Even at the present day, there are many who profess to
augur good or evil from the flight of a magpie, or from
the number of magpies seen together at one time. An
old rhyme on the subject runs <span class="no-wrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“One for sorrow, two for mirth;</div>
<div class="line">Three for a wedding, four for a birth.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The origin of the word magpie we have not heard
explained, but it is possible, from the manner in which
the name is spelled above, that “mag” may be an abbreviation
of “maggot,” pointing to a certain propensity of
the bird, which, however, is not peculiar. Those who have
spent much time in the country, must have observed not
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_121" title="121"> </a><!--145.png-->
only the magpie, but also the jackdaw and starling, busily
engaged in searching for insects on the back of a sheep.</p>

<p>As in the case of the jackdaw, the magpie is sometimes
called by the latter half of his <span class="no-wrap">name:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROOK.</div>

<p>Before taking leave of the crow family, we have yet to
notice another bird mentioned by Shakespeare, which is
nearly related to the crow. This is the Rook (<i>Corvus
frugilegus</i>). But, notwithstanding the usefulness of the
bird, the poet has not said much in its favour. It is
noticed in the song in <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, and is included
amongst the birds of omen in the quotation lately
given from Macbeth.</p>

<p>In the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, Act i. Sc. 3, we find
the expression “bully-rook,” and it would seem that this
epithet in Shakespeare’s time bore much the same signification
as “jolly-dog” does now-a-days. But it came
subsequently to have a more offensive meaning, and was
applied to a cheat and a sharper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE JAY.</div>

<p>We had well-nigh forgotten the Jay (<i>Corvus glandarius</i>),&mdash;<i>Winter’s
Tale</i> (Act iv. Sc. 3),&mdash;and only allude to it
now to show that Shakespeare has not omitted it from
his long list of birds. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, the name is applied
to a gaudily-dressed <span class="no-wrap">person:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="smaller">THE BIRDS OF SONG.</span></h2>


<p>IF there is one class of birds more than another to
which poets in all ages have been indebted for
inspiration, and to which they have directed particular
attention, it is that which includes the birds of song.
Shakespeare, as a naturalist, could not have overlooked
them. Nor has he done so. These “light-wing’d Dryads
of the trees” have received at his hands all the praise
which they deserve, while oftentimes, for melody and
pathos, he may be said to have borrowed from their
songs himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NIGHTINGALE.</div>

<p>Of all the singers in the woodland choir the Nightingale
(<i>Luscinia philomela</i>), by common consent, stands first. For
quality of voice, variety of notes, and execution, she is probably
unrivalled. Hence, with poets, she has ever been the
chief favourite. Izaak Walton has truly said, “The nightingale
breathes such sweet loud music out of her little instrumental
throat, that it might make mankind to think
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" title="124"> </a><!--148.png-->
miracles are not ceased. He that at midnight, when the
very labourer sleeps securely, should hear, as I have very
often, the clear airs, the sweet descants, the natural rising
and falling, the doubling and redoubling, of her voice,
might well be lifted above earth and say, Lord, what
music hast thou provided for the saints in heaven, when
thou affordest bad men such music on earth?” To “sing
like a nightingale” has passed into a proverb.</p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“She sings as sweetly as any nightingale.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, Act ii. Sc. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>In Gardiner’s “Music of Nature,” the following passage

<div class="sidenote">LAMENTING PHILOMEL.</div>

<p>Hence also the name Philomel, which is often applied
by the poets to this bird.</p>

<div class="line">Sing your sweet lullaby.”</div>

<div class="line">“His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day.”</div>

<p>The nightingale is again thus designated by Shakespeare
in <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2, and elsewhere; and
“the tragic tale of Philomel” is prettily referred to in
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, Act iv. Sc. 1.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SINGING AGAINST A THORN.</div>

<p>In one, if not more, of his poems he has noticed the odd
belief which formerly existed to the effect that the mournful
notes of the nightingale are caused by the bird’s leaning
against a thorn to sing!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Every thing did banish moan,</div>
<div class="line">Save the nightingale alone.</div>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_126" title="126"> </a><!--150.png-->
<div class="line">She, poor bird, as all forlorn,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Lean’d her breast up-till a thorn</i>,</div>
<div class="line">And there sung the dolefull’st ditty,</div>
<div class="line">That to hear it was great pity.</div>
<div class="line">‘Fie, fie, fie,’ now would she cry,</div>
<div class="line">‘Tereu, tereu’ by and by;</div>
<div class="line">That, to hear her so complain,</div>
<div class="line">Scarce I could from tears refrain;</div>
<div class="line">For her griefs, so lively shown,</div>
<div class="line">Made me think upon mine own.”<a id="Marker_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="marker">69</a></div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>, xix.</div>
</div>

<p>Again, Lucrece, in her distress, invoking Philomel, <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part,</div>
<div class="line">To keep thy sharp woes waking.”&mdash;<i>Lucrece.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same idea, too, has been variously expressed by
other poets than Shakespeare. Fletcher speaks <span class="no-wrap">of&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i18">                            “The bird forlorn</div>
<div class="line">That singeth with her breast against a thorn;”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and Pomfret, writing towards the close of the seventeenth
century, <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“The first music of the grove we owe</div>
<div class="line">To mourning Philomel’s harmonious woe;</div>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_127" title="127"> </a><!--151.png-->
<div class="line">And while her grief in charming notes express’d,</div>
<div class="line">A thorny bramble pricks her tender breast.</div>
<div class="line">In warbling melody she spends the night,</div>
<div class="line">And moves at once compassion and delight.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus it was evidently believed by the poets, whether the
idea was founded on fact or not, that the nightingale
leaned her breast against a thorn when she gave forth
her mournful notes. The origin of such a belief it is not
easy to ascertain, but we suspect Sir Thomas Browne was
not far from the truth when he pointed to the fact that
the nightingale frequents thorny copses, and builds her
nest amongst brambles on the ground. He inquires
“whether it be any more than that she placeth some
prickles on the outside of her nest, or roosteth in thorny,
prickly places, where serpents may least approach her?”<a id="Marker_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="marker">70</a>
In an article upon this subject, published in “The
Zoologist,” for 1862, p. 8,029, the Rev A.&nbsp;C. Smith has
narrated “the discovery, on two occasions, of a strong
thorn projecting upwards in the centre of the nightingale’s
nest.” It can hardly be doubted, however, that this was
the result of accident rather than design; and Mr. Hewitson,
in his “Eggs of British Birds,” has adduced two
similar instances in the case of the hedge-sparrow. We
may accordingly dismiss the idea that there is any real
foundation for such belief, and regard it as a poetic
license.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_128" title="128"> </a><!--152.png-->

<div class="sidenote">SINGING BY DAY AND BY NIGHT.</div>

<p>There is no doubt that one great charm in the song of
the nightingale is, that it is heard oftenest at eve, when
nearly every other bird is hushed and gone to roost. We
are thus enabled to pay more attention to it, and hear
the entire song. This evidently was Milton’s idea when he
wrote, in “Il <span class="no-wrap">Penseroso:”&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Sweet bird that shunn’st the noise of folly,</div>
<div class="line">Most musical, most melancholy!</div>
<div class="line">Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among,</div>
<div class="line">I woo, to hear thy evening song.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Portia says, in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, Act v. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 1,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="line">No better a musician than the wren.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But although she is usually supposed to withhold her
notes until sunset, and then to be the only songstress left,
she in reality sings in the day often as sweetly and as
powerfully as at night, but, amidst the general chorus of
other birds, her efforts are less noticed.<a id="Marker_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="marker">71</a> Valentine

<div class="attribution"><i>Id.</i> Act v. Sc. 4.</div>
</div>

<p>The word “record” here, refers to the singing of birds,
and, according to Douce, is derived from the recorder, a
sort of flute, by which they were taught to sing.<a id="Marker_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="marker">72</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RECORDING.</div>

<p>The “recording” of young birds is indeed always very
different from their song, as is also the warble of old birds
after moulting, as Herr Bechstein has justly remarked.
“It is,” he says, “a very striking circumstance, that birds
which continue in song nearly the whole year, such as the
redbreast, the siskin, and the goldfinch, are obliged, after
their moulting is over, to record, as if they had forgotten
their song. I am convinced, however, that this exercise
is less a study than an endeavour to bring the organs of
voice into proper flexibility, what they utter being properly
only a sort of warble, the notes of which have
scarcely any resemblance to the perfect song; and by a
little attention we may perceive how the throat is gradually
brought to emit the notes of the usual song. This view,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_130" title="130"> </a><!--154.png-->
then, leads us to ascribe the circumstance, not to defect of
memory, but rather to a roughness in the vocal organs,
arising from disuse. It is in this way that the chaffinch
makes endeavours during several successive weeks before
attaining to its former perfection, and the nightingale tries
for a long time to model the strophes of its superb song,
before it can produce the full extent of compass and
brilliancy.”<a id="Marker_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="marker">73</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LARK,</div>

<p>The nightingale has not more happily inspired our poets
than the Lark (<i>Alauda arvensis</i>). Chaucer, Spenser, Milton,
Shelley, and Wordsworth have all sung the praises of this

paid many a tribute to “the blythesome bird.” Let us, then,</p>

<p>The lark has ugly eyes, and the toad very fine ones;

have been no indication of the day’s approach, and consequently
no signal for Romeo’s departure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOARING AND SINGING.</div>

<p>To the naturalist who walks abroad at early dawn, there
are few sights more pleasing than the soaring of a lark.
As the first ray of sunshine dispels the glistening dew-drop
and gently falls to earth, the lark, warmed by its
soft touch, mounts high in air, and joyfully proclaims
to all the advent of a new day. What glee is expressed
in the song of that small brown bird, which, as it soars
towards heaven and sings, teaches us the first duty of
the day&mdash;gratitude to our Creator!</p>

<p>The bird which could inspire such thoughts as these is

surprise.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But to return to Shakespeare. Perhaps no bird has
received more notice at his hands than the one now under
consideration. To enumerate all the passages in which it
is mentioned, would probably only weary the reader. In
addition to those already named, “the shrill-gorg’d lark”
is alluded to in <i>King Lear</i> (Act iv. Sc. 6); while to sing
“as sweetly as the lark” has passed into a proverb
(<i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Act v. Sc. 1).</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_136" title="136"> </a><!--160.png-->

<p>Mention is made of this bird in <i>Titus Andronicus</i>
(Act ii. Sc. 3, and Act iii. Sc. 1); in <i>Cymbeline</i> (Act iii.
Sc. 6); and in <i>Richard II.</i> (Act iii. Sc. 3).</p>

<p>Formerly, a curious method of taking larks was practised
by means of small pieces of looking-glass and red
cloth. These were made to move at a little distance from
the fowler by means of a string, and when the birds,
impelled by curiosity, came within range, they were taken
in a net. This practice is referred to by Shakespeare in
<span class="no-wrap"><i>Henry VIII.</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i10">              “Let his grace go forward,</div>

<div class="attribution"><i>Henry VIII.</i> Act iii. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>The cap in this case was the scarlet hat of the Cardinal,
which it was intended to use as a piece of red cloth. It
seems probable, from the context, that the word “dare”
should be “draw.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COMMON BUNTING.</div>

<p>A bird which is often taken with larks, and which,
indeed, is not unlike one in appearance, is the Common
Bunting (<i>Emberiza miliaria</i>). In some parts of the
country it is known as the Bunting-Lark, and, from its size
and general colouring, a casual observer might easily
mistake it for one of the last-named species. No wonder,
then, that the old lord Lafeu <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THROSTLE.</div>

<p>It is somewhat singular that the Thrush (<i>Turdus musicus</i>),
a bird as much famed for song as either the nightingale or
the lark, has been so little noticed by Shakespeare. We
have failed to discover more than three passages in the
entire works of our great poet in which this well-known
bird is mentioned. It is referred to once in <i>A Winter’s
Tale</i> (Act iv. Sc. 2); once in <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>,
Act iii. Sc. 1, where Bottom the weaver, in a doggrel
rhyme, sings <span class="no-wrap">of&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“The throstle, with his note so true;”</div>
</div>

<p>and once again in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> (Act i. Sc. 2),
where Portia, speaking of the French Lord Le Bon, and
alluding to his national propensity for a dance on every
available opportunity, remarks <span class="no-wrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-capering.”</div>
</div>

<p>Many naturalists, who have paid particular attention to
the song of the thrush, have insisted upon its taking
equal rank as a songster with the more favoured nightingale.
Certain it is, that the notes of this bird, although
not so varied, nor so liquid, so to say, as those of
Philomel, are yet of a clear, rich tone, and have something
indescribably sweet about them. “Listen,” says
Macgillivray, “to the clear, loud notes of that speckled
warbler, that in the softened sunshine pours forth his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_138" title="138"> </a><!--162.png-->

resemble?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It must be admitted by all who have paid particular
attention to the song of the thrush, that this is a wonderful
imitation, so far as words can express notes. The
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_139" title="139"> </a><!--163.png-->
first four lines, lines 7, 13, and 14, and the last five lines in
particular, approach remarkably close in sound to the
original; and this is rendered the more apparent if we
endeavour to pronounce the words by whistling.</p>

<p>Intimately associated with the thrush is its congener
the Blackbird (<i>Turdus merula</i>). Both visitors to our lawns
and shrubberies, they remind us of their presence, when
we do not see them, by their sweet, clear notes, and when
the cold of winter has made them silent, we are still
charmed with their sprightly actions, and the beauty of
their plumage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OUZEL.</div>

<p>The attractive appearance of the blackbird was not
overlooked by Shakespeare, who has mentioned him in
one of his <span class="no-wrap">songs:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>an expression which was probably equivalent to the
modern phrase, a “black sheep.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REDBREAST.</div>

<p>Amongst the songsters of less note mentioned by
Shakespeare, are the Robin-redbreast (<i>Erythaca rubecula</i>)
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140" title="140"> </a><!--164.png-->
and the Wren (<i>Troglodytes vulgaris</i>). These two birds
have for centuries, from some unexplained cause, been
always associated together. The country people, in
many parts of England, still regard them as the male
and female of one species, and support their assertion
with an old <span class="no-wrap">couplet&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“The robin-redbreast and the wren</div>
<div class="line">Are God Almighty’s cock and hen.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In these days, when so much more attention is paid to
ornithology than formerly, it will be hardly necessary to
observe that the two birds thus associated together are
not only of very distinct species, but belong to widely
different genera.</p>

<p>An old name for the redbreast is “ruddock”<a id="Marker_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="marker">75</a> the
meaning of which is illustrated in the word “ruddy;” and
the bird is still known by this name in some parts of
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COVERING THE DEAD WITH LEAVES.</div>

<p>Bishop Percy asks, “Is this an allusion to the ‘Babes in
the Wood,’ or was the notion of the redbreast covering dead
bodies general before the writing of that ballad?” Mr.
Knight says, “There is no doubt that it was an old popular
belief, and the notion has been found in an earlier book
of natural history.” John Webster, writing in 1638, says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Call for the robin-redbreast and the wren,</div>
<div class="line">Since o’er shady groves they hover,</div>
<div class="line">And with leaves and flowers do cover</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Izaak Walton, in his “Compleat Angler,” 1653, speaks
of “the honest robin that loves mankind, <i>both alive and
dead</i>.” Possibly Shakespeare intended only to refer to the
ancient and beautiful custom of strewing the grave with
flowers.</p>

<p>With all birds it is the habit of the male to sing while
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_142" title="142"> </a><!--166.png-->
courting the female. So, when Valentine asks Speed,
“How know you that I am in love?” he gives, amongst
other reasons, that he had learnt “to relish a love-song
like a robin-redbreast.”&mdash;<i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act ii.

<p>Possibly the allusion may be to the “recorder,” by which

high compliment to the vocal powers of Lady Percy by
insinuating that her voice would excel the recorder; and
as the bird most frequently taught to pipe is the bullfinch,
it is not improbable that this was the bird intended under
the title of “redbreast,” and not the robin.</p>

<p>There are three statements here which are likely to be
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_144" title="144"> </a><!--168.png-->
criticised by the ornithologist. First, that the wren is
the smallest of birds, which is evidently an oversight.
Secondly, that the wren has sufficient courage to fight
against a bird of prey in defence of its young, which is
doubtful. Thirdly, that the owl will take young birds
from the nest. As to this last point, see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_91">pp. 91&ndash;94</a>.</p>

<p>Imogen has made mention of the wren, as <span class="no-wrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Finch” is only once mentioned, <i>i.e.</i> in a song in
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, Act iii. Sc. 1. In <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>, however, when Thersites and Patroclus are
abusing each other (Act v. Sc. 1), the former calls the
latter “finch-egg.” But what species of Finch the poet
had in view, it is not easy to determine. It may have
been the Bullfinch, but it is more likely to have been the
Chaffinch, which has always been a favourite cage-bird
with the lower classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SPARROW.</div>

<p>The Hedge-sparrow (<i>Accentor modularis</i>), a frequenter of
the same haunts, has been more frequently noticed by
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_145" title="145"> </a><!--169.png-->
Shakespeare than the wren. In many passages throughout
the Plays mention is made of “the sparrow” without the
prefix “hedge” or “house.” Occasionally we are enabled,
from the context, to determine the species; but as this is
not always the case, we propose to consider under one
head all that Shakespeare has said of either species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHILIP SPARROW.</div>

<p>The ingratitude of the young cuckoo, which is said to
turn out the young of its foster parent as soon as it is
sufficiently strong, has given rise in France to the proverb
“Ingrat comme un coucou.”</p>

<p>The word “gull” above mentioned is usually applied
to the person “gulled,” <i>i.e.</i> beguiled. Here it must either
mean the “guller,” or it must have a special application to
the voracity of the cuckoo, as the sea-gull is supposed to
be so called from <i>gulo&mdash;ōnis</i>.</p>

<p>We gather from Decker’s “English Villanies” that formerly
the sharpers termed their gang a <i>warren</i>, and their
simple victims <i>rabbit-suckers</i>, or <i>conies</i>. At other times
their confederates were called <i>bird-catchers</i>, and their prey
<i>gulls;</i> and hence it was common to say of any person who
had been swindled or hoaxed, that he was <i>coney-catched</i>

<p>This passage always brings to our recollection those
beautiful lines which Wordsworth addressed “To the
Cuckoo,” and which must be so well known to all.</p>

<p>The cuckoo, as long ago remarked by John Heywood,<a id="Marker_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="marker">80</a>
begins to sing early in the season with the interval of a
minor third; the bird then proceeds to a major third,
next to a fourth, then a fifth, after which its voice
breaks, without attaining a minor sixth. It may,
therefore, be said to have done much for musical
science, because from this bird has been derived the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" title="151"> </a><!--175.png-->
minor scale, the origin of which has puzzled so many;
the cuckoo’s couplet being the minor third sung downwards.
Kircher, however,<a id="Marker_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="marker">81</a> gives it <span class="no-wrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A friend of Gilbert White’s found upon trial that the
note of the cuckoo varies in different individuals. About
Selborne Wood he found they were mostly in D. He
heard two sing together, the one in D, the other in D
sharp, which made a very disagreeable duet. He afterwards
heard one in D sharp, and about Wolmer Forest
some in C.</p>

<p>Gungl, in his “Cuckoo Galop,” gives the note of the
cuckoo as B natural and G sharp. Dr. Arne, in his music
to the cuckoo’s song in <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, gives it as
C natural and G.</p>

<p>And now “will you hear the dialogue that the two
learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the

</div>
</div>

<p>But, as in all the other stanzas the rhymes are alternate,
this was most probably an error of the compositor. The
transposition now generally adopted was first made by
Theobald.</p>

<p>The notion which couples the name of the cuckoo with
the character of the man whose wife is unfaithful to him,
appears to have been derived from the Romans, and is
first found in the middle ages in France, and in the
countries of which the modern language is derived from
the Latin. We are not aware that it existed originally
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_154" title="154"> </a><!--178.png-->
amongst the Teutonic race, and we have doubtless
received it from the Normans. The opinion that the
cuckoo made no nest of its own, but laid its eggs in that
of another bird, which brought up the young cuckoo to
the detriment of its own offspring, was well-known to the
ancients, and is mentioned by Aristotle and Pliny.</p>

<p>So in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> (Act ii. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 6):&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house;</div>
<div class="line">But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,</div>
<div class="line">Remain in ’t as thou may’st.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the ancients more correctly gave the name of the
bird, not to the husband of the faithless wife, but to her
paramour, who might justly be supposed to be acting the
part of the cuckoo. They gave the name of the bird in
whose nest the cuckoo’s eggs were usually deposited&mdash;“<i>curruca</i>”&mdash;to
the husband. It is not quite clear how,
in the passage from classic to mediæval, the application of
the term was transferred to the husband.<a id="Marker_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="marker">85</a> In allusion to
this are the following lines of <span class="no-wrap">Shakespeare:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This song is preserved amongst the Harleian MSS.,
No. 978, and is remarkable for being accompanied with
musical notes, and as being the oldest sample of English
secular music.</p>

<p>The Wagtail (<i>Motacilla Yarrellii</i>) has no claim to be
included amongst the birds of song, but as the latter are
chiefly small birds, and as Shakespeare has only alluded
to it once, we may be excused for introducing it in the
present chapter.</p>

<p>In an opprobrious sense, the word “wagtail” would
doubtless denote a pert, flippant fellow. Kent, in <i>King
Lear</i> (Act ii. Sc. 2), <span class="no-wrap">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“Spare my grey beard, you <i>wagtail!</i>”</div>
</div>

<p>In many parts of the country this bird is called “dishwasher,”
and the name appears to be of some antiquity.
Turbervile, in his “Booke of Falconrie,” 1575, speaking
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_157" title="157"> </a><!--181.png-->
of the various kinds of animals and birds whose flesh
is proper for hawks to feed on, says (p. 137),&mdash;“The
flesh of these flesh-crowes (<i>i.e.</i> carrion crows), and of the
wagtayles (or <i>dishwasher</i>, as we tearme them, in Latin
called <i>Motacilla</i>), and the cormorant, is of euil nourishment
and digestion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRD-CATCHING.</div>

<p>While on the subject of small birds in general, and
song birds in particular, it will be interesting to glance at
the methods which were formerly practised for catching
them. These methods were many and various in kind.
Springes, gins, bat-fowling, bird-lime, bird-bolts, and birding-pieces
are all mentioned by Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The “springe” and the “gin” we shall have occasion to
notice later in our remarks upon the Woodcock, for which
bird these snares were usually employed. The ancient
practice of “bat-fowling,” or “bat-folding,” is noticed in
“<i>The Tempest</i>,” Act ii. <span class="no-wrap">Sc. 1:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“He would so, and then go <i>a bat-fowling</i>.”</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">BAT-FOWLING.</div>

<p>In Markham’s “Hunger’s Prevention,” 1600, are some
curious directions on this subject, which afford a very good
idea of the way in which this sport was practised
<span class="no-wrap">formerly:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“For the manner of bat-fowling, it may be used either
with nettes or without nettes.</p>

<p>“If you vse it without nettes (which indeed is the most
common of the two), you shall then proceed in this manner.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_158" title="158"> </a><!--182.png-->
First, there shall be one to carry the cresset of fire<a id="Marker_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="marker">86</a> (as
was showed for the <i>low-bell</i>), then a certaine number, as
two, three, or foure (according to the greatness of your
company), and these shall have poales bound with dry
round wispes of hay, straw, or such like stuffe, or else
bound with pieces of linkes or hurdes dipt in pitch, rosen,
grease, or any such like matter that will blaze. Then
another company shall be armed with long poales, very
rough and bushy at the vpper endes, of which the
willow, byrche, or long hazell are best, but indeede
according as the country will afford, so you must be
content to take.</p>

<p>“Thus being prepared, and comming into the bushy or
rough grounde, where the haunts of byrdes are, you shall
then first kindle some of your fiers, as halfe or a third part,
according as your prouision is, and then with your other
bushy and rough poales you shall beat the bushes, trees,
and haunts of the birds, to enforce them to rise, which
done you shall see the birds which are raysed, to flye and
playe about the lights and flames of the fier, for it is their
nature through their amazednesse and affright at the
strangenes of the light and the extreame darknesse round
about it, not to depart from it, but, as it were, almost to
scorch their wings in the same: so that those whice haue
the rough bushye poales may (at their pleasures) beat
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_159" title="159"> </a><!--183.png-->
them down with the same and so take them. Thus you
may spend as much of the night as is darke, for longer is
not conuenient, and doubtlesse you shall find much pastime,
and take great store of birds, and in this you shall obserue
all the obseruations formerly treated of in the <i>Low-bell;</i>
especially that of silence, until your lights be kindled, but
then you may use your pleasure, for the noyse and the
light when they are heard and scene afarre of, they make
the byrdes sit the faster and surer.</p>

<p>“The byrdes which are commonly taken by this labour
or exercise are, for the most part, the rookes, ring-doues,
blackbirdes, throstles, feldyfares, linnets, bulfinches, and
all other byrdes whatsouer that pearch or sit vpon small
boughes or bushes.”</p>

<p>The term “bat-fowling,” however, had another signification
in Shakespeare’s day, and it may have been in this
secondary sense that it is used in the last quotation.
It was a slang word for a particular mode of cheating,
just as other modes, in the same age, were known as
“gull-groping,” “sheep-shearing,” “lime-twigging,” “spoon-dropping,”
“stone-carrying,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Bat-fowling” was practised about dusk, when the rogue
pretended to have dropped a ring or a jewel at the door
of some well-furnished shop, and, going in, asked the
apprentice of the house to light his candle to look for it.
After some peering about, the bat-fowler would drop the
candle, as if by accident.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_160" title="160"> </a><!--184.png-->

<p>“Now, I pray you, good young man,” he would say, “do
so much as light the candle again.” While the boy was
away the rogue plundered the shop, and having stole
everything he could find, stole away himself.<a id="Marker_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="marker">87</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_162" title="162"> </a><!--186.png-->

<p>Procure a square frame covered on one side with wire

twig between fork and front, and after raising hoop
about two inches, insert the other end of the twig,
so as to rest against the hoop, and press <i>outwards</i>. This
will hold the hoop up. A bird, on approaching the trap,
hops on the hoop to get at the grain within it, when the
hoop will go down with the weight and let go the twig,
which being pliant flies out, and the fork (being only
<i>outside</i> the front) of course falls, and so does the trap.</p>

<p>The “bird bolts” mentioned by Shakespeare in <i>Twelfth
Night</i> (Act i. Sc. 5), <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> (Act iv. Sc. 3),
and <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> (Act i. Sc. 1), were the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_163" title="163"> </a><!--187.png-->
“bolts,” or “quarrels” as they were sometimes called,
which were shot from the cross-bow, or “stone-bow,”
<i>Twelfth Night</i> (Act ii. Sc. 5). The latter was simply a
cross-bow made for propelling stones or bullets, in contradistinction
to a bow that shot arrows. Sir John
Bramston, in his Autobiography (p. 108) says:&mdash;“Litle
more than a yeare after I maried, I and my wife being
at Skreenes with my father (the plague being soe in
London, and my building not finished), I had exercised
myself with a <i>stone-bow</i>, and a spar-hawke at the bush.”</p>

<p>There were two denominations of cross-bows&mdash;latches
and prodds. The former were the military weapons, and
were bent with one or both feet, by putting them into a
kind of stirrup at the extremity, and then drawing the
cord upward with the hands; the latter were chiefly used
for sporting purposes. They were bent with the hand, by
means of a small steel lever, called the goat’s-foot, on
account of its being forked or cloven on the side that
rested on the cross-bow and the cord. The bow itself was
usually made of steel, though sometimes of wood or
horn.<a id="Marker_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="marker">88</a></p>

<p>The missiles discharged from them were not only
arrows, which were shorter and stouter than those of
the long-bow, but also bolts (<i>bolzen</i>, German; <i>quarreaux</i>,
or <i>carrieaux</i>, French; <i>quadrelli</i>, Latin, corrupted into
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_164" title="164"> </a><!--188.png-->
“quarrels,” from their pyramidal form), and also stones or

<div class="sidenote">BIRDING-PIECES.</div>

<p>The “birding-pieces” which Mrs. Ford tells Falstaff are
always “discharged” up the chimney, were no doubt
the old-fashioned fowling-pieces which were in use in
those days.</p>

<p>According to Sir S.&nbsp;D. Scott,<a id="Marker_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="marker">89</a> the “birding-piece”
was identical with the “snap-hance,” the early form of
that process of ignition&mdash;the flint and steel lock&mdash;which
has survived nearly 300 years, and specimens of which,
although now becoming rare, may occasionally be met
with in use, even at the present day. It was a Dutch
invention; and is said to have been brought into use by
marauders, whom the Dutch called <i>snap-haans</i>, or poultry
stealers. The light from the burning match, which
necessarily accompanied the match-lock, exposed them to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_165" title="165"> </a><!--189.png-->
detection; and the wheel-lock was an article too expensive
for them to purchase, as well as being liable to get out of
order; so this lock was devised, and was suggested, no
doubt, by the wheel-lock. It consisted in the substitution
of flint for pyrites, and a furrowed plate of steel in lieu of
the wheel. When the trigger was pulled, it brought this
jagged piece of steel in collision with the flint, which
threw down its shower of sparks into the open pan, and
lighted the priming. This improvement apparently took
place about the close of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>There is a very early “snap-hance” in the Tower
Collection, numbered 12/79. It is a “birding-piece” of
Prince Charles, afterwards King Charles I., date 1614, and
furnishes a good illustration of the form of gun in use in
Shakespeare’s day. It is engraved both on lock and
barrel. The butt is remarkably thin; the length of the
whole arm is four feet two inches, and was consequently
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_166" title="166"> </a><!--190.png-->
adapted for a youth like the Prince, who, at the date
above mentioned, was fourteen years of age.</p>

have been in far greater danger than the bird at which
he aimed.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BIRDS UNDER DOMESTICATION.</span></h2>


<p>IT would hardly be supposed that the birds under
domestication could inspire much poetical feeling, or
indeed that they could furnish the dramatist with much
imagery. Those, however, who may entertain this view, on
reading the works of Shakespeare, must admit that in his
case at least they are mistaken. The Cock, the Peacock,
the Turkey, the Pigeon, the Goose, the Duck and the Swan,
are all noticed in their turn, and indeed, in the ordinary
list of poultry, hardly a species has escaped mention. In
the succeeding chapter, when treating of the game-birds,
we shall notice the Pheasant, Partridge, and Quail, which
are occasionally domesticated. For the present, it will be
as well to confine our attention to the birds above
mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COCK.</div>

<p>“The early village cock” (<i>Richard III.</i> Act v. Sc. 3),
“the trumpet to the morn” (<i>Hamlet</i>, Act i. Sc. 1), is often
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" title="168"> </a><!--192.png-->
noticed by Shakespeare. In the prologue to the fourth
act of <span class="no-wrap"><i>King Henry V.</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">COCK-CROW.</div>

<p>Steevens has shown that the popular notion of a phantom
disappearing at cock-crow is of very ancient date. The
conversation of Bernardo, Horatio, and Marcellus, on the
subject of Hamlet’s ghost, affords a good illustration of
<span class="no-wrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">

<p>“Hark! hark! I hear the strain of strutting chanticleer
cry cockadidle-dowe.”<!--TN: added end quote-->&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>, Act i. Sc. 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as “cock-crow” denotes the early morning, so is
“cock-shut-time” or “cock-close,” expressive of the evening;
although some consider that the latter phrase owes its
origin to the practice of netting woodcocks at twilight,
that is, shutting or enclosing them in a net.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COCK-A-HOOP.</div>

<p>The origin of the phrase “cock-a-hoop,” which occurs
in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act i. Sc. 5, is very doubtful: the
passage <span class="no-wrap">is&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!</div>
<div class="line">You will set <i>cock-a-hoop!</i> you’ll be the man!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some commentators consider that this refers in some
way to the boastful crowing of the cock, but we do not
think that Shakespeare intended any allusion here to the
game-fowl. We take it that the reference is to a cask of
ale or wine, and that the phrase “to set cock-a-hoop” means
to take the cock, or tap, out of the cask and set it on the
hoop, thus letting all the contents escape. The man who
would do such a reckless act, would be just the sort of
man to whom Shakespeare refers.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" title="170"> </a><!--194.png-->

<p>The ale-house sign of “The Cock and Hoop” represents
a game-fowl standing upon a hoop, but we have
little doubt that the original sign was a cask flowing, with
the tap laid on the top. The modern version is no doubt
a corruption, just as we have “The Swan with Two
<i>Necks</i>” for “The Swan with Two <i>Nicks</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> marks on
the bill to distinguish it; “The Devil and the Bag o’
Nails” for “Pan and the Bacchanals;” “The Goat and
Compasses” for the ancient motto “God encompasseth
us;” &amp;c., &amp;c.<a id="Marker_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="marker">91</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">COCK AND PYE.</div>

<p>The popular adjuration, “by cock and pye,” which
Shakespeare has put in the mouth of Justice Shallow, was
once supposed to refer to the sacred name, and to the
table of services, called “the pie;” but it is now thought
to be what Hotspur termed a mere “protest of pepper
gingerbread,” as innocent as Slender’s, “By these gloves,”
or, “By this hat.” In “Soliman and Perseda” (1599),<!--TN: was (1599,)--> it
occurs coupled with “mousefoot;”&mdash;“By cock and pye and
mousefoot.” Again, in “The Plaine Man’s Pathway to
Heaven,” by Arthur Dent (1607), we have the following
<span class="no-wrap">dialogue:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i class="speaker">Asunetus.</i>&mdash;“I know a man that will never swear but by
<i>cock</i> or <i>py</i>, or <i>mousefoot</i>. I hope you will not say these be
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_171" title="171"> </a><!--195.png-->
oaths. For he is as honest a man as ever brake bread.
You shall not hear an oath come out of his mouth.”</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Theologus.</i>&mdash;“I do not think he is so honest a man as
you make him. For it is no small sin to swear by
creatures.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Cock and Pye (<i>i.e.</i> Magpie) was an ordinary ale-house
sign, and may thus have become a subject for the
vulgar to swear by. Douce, however, ascribes to it a less
ignoble origin, and his interpretation is too ingenious to
be passed over in silence:&mdash;“It will no doubt be recollected
that in the days of ancient chivalry it was
the practice to make solemn vows or engagements for
the performance of some considerable enterprise. This
ceremony was usually performed during some grand feast
or entertainment, at which a roasted peacock or pheasant
being served up by ladies in a dish of gold or silver, was
thus presented to each knight, who then made the particular
vow which he had chosen with great solemnity.
When this custom had fallen into disuse, the peacock
nevertheless continued to be a favourite dish, and was
introduced on the table in a pie, the head, with gilded
beak, being proudly elevated above the crust, and the
splendid tail expanded. Other birds of less value were
introduced in the same manner, and the recollection of
the old peacock vows might occasion the less serious, or
even burlesque, imitation of swearing not only by the bird
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_172" title="172"> </a><!--196.png-->
itself, but also by the <i>pye;</i> and hence, probably, the oath
‘by cock and pye,’ for the use of which no very old
authority can be found.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">COCK-FIGHTING.</div>

<p>The pastime of cock-fighting, to which Shakespeare has
alluded in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, is no doubt of some
antiquity. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes of the
People of England,” does not give any history of its
introduction, but quotes from Burton (1660), and Powell
(1696), to show that the sport was well known at those
dates. It was much in vogue in Shakespeare’s day, and
the great dramatist is probably not wrong in leading us to
suppose that it was first introduced by the <span class="no-wrap">Romans:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“His cocks do win the battle still of mine,</div>
<div class="line">When it is all to nought.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act ii. Sc. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>“Cock-fighting took place generally between August
and May. Six weeks before a battle, the champions were
confined in separate pens, and fed with bread. Their
spurs were then wrapped in leather, and they were allowed
to spar, and sweated in straw baskets, and fed with sugar-candy,
chopped rosemary, and butter, to strengthen them
and give them wind. Roots dipped in wine, and oatmeal
kneaded with ale and eggs, were also allowed them, as
purges and diaphoretics. Every day the feeder had to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_173" title="173"> </a><!--197.png-->
lick his bird’s eye, and lead and encourage him to pursue
a dunghill fowl which he held in his arms, and ran with
before him. The last fortnight the sparring was discontinued,
and four days next allowed before the bird was
brought into the pit, and always fasting.</p>

<p>“In matching birds, it was necessary to consider their
strength and length&mdash;the weak, long bird rising with more
ease, and the short, strong bird giving the surer and
deadlier blow.</p>

<p>“The game cocks were prepared for battle by cutting off
the mane all but a small ruff, and clipping off the feathers
from the tail. The wings were cut short, and sharp points
left, to endanger the eye of the antagonist. The spurs
were scraped and sharpened, but steel spurs were not used
at this early period, though the sport was as old as the
Athenians. The preparation was completed by removing
all the feathers from the crown of the head. The feeder,
then licking his pupil all over, turned him into the pit, to
win his gold and move his fortune.</p>

<p>“The birds were generally brought into the arena in
linen bags, in which they came from Norwich or Wisbeach.</p>

<p>“They began the combat by whetting their beaks upon
the ground, and continued the fight till they were both
blind, or faint from loss of blood. The feeder had to suck
the wounds of the living bird, and powder them with
dust of the herb Robert. If the eye were hurt, the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_174" title="174"> </a><!--198.png-->
cocker chewed ground ivy, and applied the juice to the
wound.”<a id="Marker_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="marker">92</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ANCESTRY OF DOMESTIC COCK.</div>

<p>Whether the various breeds of domestic fowls have
diverged by independent and different roads from a single
type, which is most probable, or whether they have descended
from several distinct wild species, as some naturalists
maintain, is a question which can scarcely be
answered in the present treatise. A separate volume
might be written on the subject. Nevertheless, the general
opinion is that all the various breeds have descended from
a common wild ancestor&mdash;the <i>Gallus bankiva</i> of India.
This species has a wide geographical range. It inhabits
Northern India as far west as Scinde, and ascends the
Himalaya to a height of 4,000 feet. It is found in
Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, the Indo-Chinese countries,
the Philippine Islands, and the Malayan Archipelago, as far
eastward as Timor. Mr. Darwin has shown<a id="Marker_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="marker">93</a> that it varies
considerably in the wild state, and observes<a id="Marker_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="marker">94</a> that “from
the extremely close resemblance in colour, general structure,
and especially in voice, between <i>Gallus bankiva</i> and
the game-fowl; from their fertility, as far as this has been
ascertained, when crossed; from the possibility of the wild
species being tamed, and from its varying in the wild
state, we may confidently look at it as the parent of the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_175" title="175"> </a><!--199.png-->
most typical of all the domestic breeds, namely, the game-fowl.
It is a significant fact that almost all the naturalists
in India, namely, Sir W. Elliot, Mr. S.&nbsp;N. Ward, Mr.
Layard, Mr. T.&nbsp;C. Jerdon, and Mr. Blyth, who are familiar
with <i>Gallus bankiva</i>, believe that it is the parent of most
or all of our domestic breeds.”</p>

<p>Whether our birds are descended from those introduced
into Europe in the time of Alexander, or have been
subsequently imported, is doubtful. They vary but little
under domestication, except in sometimes being white or
piebald.<a id="Marker_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="marker">96</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS INTRODUCTION.</div>

<p>A curious fact with respect to the peacock may here be
noticed, namely, the occasional appearance in England of
the “japanned” or “black-shouldered” kind. This form
has been regarded by Mr. Sclater as a distinct species,
under the name of <i>Pavo nigripennis</i>, and he believes it
will hereafter be found wild in some country, but not in
India, where it is certainly unknown.<a id="Marker_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="marker">97</a> These japanned
birds differ conspicuously from the common peacock, and
can be propagated perfectly true. Nevertheless, Mr.
Darwin gives it as his opinion that “the evidence seems
to preponderate strongly in favour of the black-shouldered
breed being a variation, induced either by the
climate of England, or by some unknown cause, such
as reversion to a primordial and extinct condition of the
species.”<a id="Marker_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="marker">98</a></p>

<p>Formerly the peacock was in much request for the
table, but now-a-days the species appears to be preserved
for ornament rather than use. According to the “Northumberland
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_177" title="177"> </a><!--201.png-->

for the table in 1512 was twelvepence; but we must

than it is now considered to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TURKEY.</div>

<p>Shakespeare has committed a curious anachronism

<p>“These facts,” observes Mr. Blyth,<a id="Marker_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="marker">101</a> “are generally

<div class="sidenote">TURKEY-FOWL AND GUINEA-FOWL.</div>

<p>The origin of the English name turkey, as applied to
a bird indigenous to America, has provoked much discussion.
The best explanation is that given by Mr.
Blyth, in the work last quoted<span class="no-wrap"><a id="Marker_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="marker">102</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It is certain,” he says, “that the <i>Guinea-fowl</i> was
commonly termed the <i>Turkey-hen</i> in former days, and
hence a difficulty sometimes in knowing which bird is
meant by sundry old authors. As the Portuguese discoveries
along the west coast of Africa preceded those
of the Spaniards in America, there is reason to infer that
our British ancestors became acquainted with the guinea-fowl
prior to their knowledge of the turkey; and the
English trade being then chiefly with the Levantine
countries, our ancestors may well have fancied that it
came from thence. Referring to a curious old dictionary
in my possession (published in 1678) for the word
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_179" title="179"> </a><!--203.png-->
<i>Melcagris</i>, I find it translated ’a Guinny or Turkey
Hen:’ <i>Gallinæ Africanæ sen Numidicæ</i>, Var. ‘sine quæ
vulgo Indicæ’ (<i>Coq d’Inde</i> of the French, corrupted into
<i>Dinde</i> and <i>Dindon!</i>). Again, <i>Numidica guttata</i> of Martial
is rendered ‘a Ginny or Turkey Hen.’ Looking also
into an English and Spanish Dictionary of so late a
date as 1740, I find <i>Gallipavo</i> rendered ‘a Turkey or
Guinea Cock or Hen.’ Well, it is known that our British
forefathers originally derived the domestic turkey from
Spain, and meanwhile they are likely to have obtained
a knowledge of the true <i>habitat</i> of the guinea-fowl, and
therefore may very probably have supposed the former
to be the real <i>turkey</i>-fowl, as distinguished from the
<i>guinea</i>-fowl; and if the word ‘fowl’ be dropped in the
one instance and not in the other, be it remembered
that there was another special meaning for the word
<i>Guinea</i>, having reference to the Gold Coast, otherwise
the bird might have come to be known as the ‘guinea,’
as the bantam-fowl is now currently designated the
‘bantam,’ and the canary-bird as the ‘canary,’ or the
turkey-fowl the ‘turkey.’ The Latin-sounding name
<i>Gallipavo</i> seems to be of Spanish origin, and obtains
among the Spaniards to this day; but their earliest name
for it was ‘<i>Pavon de las Indias</i>,’ ‘c’est-à-dire,’ as Buffon
remarks, ‘<i>Paon des Indes Occidentales;</i>’ which explains the
reference to India perpetuated in ‘<i>Dindon</i>.’”</p>

<p>The turkey is again mentioned by Shakespeare in

<div class="sidenote">THE PIGEON:</div>

<p>The Pigeon and the Dove are repeatedly mentioned in
the works of Shakespeare, although on different grounds.
The former bird is noticed as a letter-carrier (<i>Titus Andronicus</i>,
Act iv. Sc. 3), as an article of food (<i>Henry IV.</i>
Part II. Act v. Sc. 1), and as an example of conjugal
fidelity and attachment to offspring (<i>As You Like It</i>, Act i.
Sc. 2, and Act iii. Sc. 3). The latter is alluded to
as the emblem of peace (<i>Henry IV.</i> Part I. Act iv.
Sc. 1.; <i>Henry VIII.</i> Act iv. Sc. 1), modesty (<i>Taming of
the Shrew</i>, Act iii. Sc. 2), patience (<i>Hamlet</i>, Act v.
Sc. 1), innocence (<i>Henry VI.</i> Part II. Act iii. Sc. 1),
fidelity (<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act iii. Sc. 2; <i>Winter’s Tale</i>,
Act iv. Sc. 3), and love (<i>Venus and Adonis;</i> <i>Henry VI.</i>
Part I. Act ii. Sc. 2; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act ii. Sc. 5).</p>

<p>In one passage only is the word “dove” used synonymously
for “pigeon.” In <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> we are told of
the nurse “sitting in the sun under the <i>dove</i>-house wall”

<div class="sidenote">ITS EARLY DOMESTICATION.</div>

<p>The practice, here alluded to, of keeping pigeons in a
domesticated state is of very ancient date. Mr. Darwin
has been at considerable pains to collect information
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_181" title="181"> </a><!--205.png-->
upon this point, and in his admirable work “On the
Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,”
he gives the following <span class="no-wrap">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PIGEON-FANCIERS.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>“The earliest record, as has been pointed out to me by
Professor Lepsius, of pigeons in a domesticated condition,
occurs in the fifth Egyptian dynasty, about 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>; but
Mr. Birch, of the British Museum, informs me that the
pigeon appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty.<a id="Marker_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="marker">103</a>
Domestic pigeons are mentioned in Genesis, Leviticus,
and Isaiah. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from
Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; ‘nay, they
are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their
pedigree and race.’ In India, about the year 1600,
pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan: 20,000 birds
were carried about with the court, and the merchants
brought valuable collections. ‘The monarchs of Iran and
Turan sent him some very rare breeds. His Majesty,’
says the courtly historian, ‘by crossing the breeds, which
method was never practised before, has improved them
astonishingly. Akber Khan possessed seventeen distinct
kinds, eight of which were valuable for beauty alone. At
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_182" title="182"> </a><!--206.png-->
about this same period of 1600, the Dutch, according to
Aldrovandus, were as eager about pigeons as the Romans
had formerly been. The breeds which were kept during
the fifteenth century in Europe and in India, apparently
differed from each other. Tavernier, in his ‘Travels,’ in
1677, speaks as does Chardin, in 1735, of the vast numbers
of pigeon-houses in Persia; and the former remarks,
that as Christians were not permitted to keep pigeons,
some of the vulgar actually turned Mahometans for this
sole purpose. The Emperor of Morocco had his favourite
keeper of pigeons, as is mentioned in Moore’s treatise,
published 1737. In England, from the time of 1678 to
the present day, as well as in Germany and in France,
numerous treatises have been published on the pigeon.
In India, about a hundred years ago, a Persian treatise
was written; and the writer thought it no light affair, for
he begins with a solemn invocation, ‘In the name of God,
the gracious and merciful.’ Many large towns in Europe
and the United States now have their societies of
devoted pigeon-fanciers: at present there are three such
societies in London. In India, as I hear from Mr. Blyth,
the inhabitants of Delhi and of some other great cities
are eager fanciers. Mr. Layard informs me that most of
the known breeds are kept in Ceylon. In China, according
to Mr. Swinhoe of Amoy, and Dr. Lockhart of
Shanghai<!--TN: original reads 'Shangai'-->, carriers, fantails, tumblers, and other varieties
are reared with care, especially by the bonzes, or priests.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_183" title="183"> </a></p>

<!--207.png-->

<p>“The Chinese fasten a kind of whistle to the tail-feathers
of their pigeons, and as the flock wheels through
the air, they produce a sweet sound.<a id="Marker_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="marker">104</a> In Egypt, the
late Abbas Pacha was a great fancier of fantails. Many
pigeons are kept at Cairo and Constantinople, and these
have lately been imported by native merchants, as I hear
from Sir W. Elliot, into Southern India, and sold at high
prices.</p>

<p>“The foregoing statements show in how many countries,
and during how long a period, many men have been passionately
devoted to the breeding of pigeons.”<a id="Marker_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="marker">105</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CARRIER-PIGEONS.</div>

<p>In <i>Titus Andronicus</i> (Act iv. Sc. 3), upon the entry of
a clown with two pigeons Titus <span class="no-wrap">exclaims:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“News, news from heaven! Marcus, <i>the post is come</i>.</div>
<div class="line">Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The practice of using pigeons as letter-carriers, here
alluded to by Shakespeare, is doubtless of very ancient
origin. The old historian Diodorus Siculus, informs us
that above two thousand years ago they were employed
for this purpose; and five hundred years since relays of
carrier-pigeons formed part of a telegraphic system
adopted by the Turks. “Regular chains of posts were
established, consisting of high towers between thirty and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_184" title="184"> </a><!--208.png-->
forty miles asunder, provided with pigeons, and sentinels
stood there constantly on the watch, to secure the intelligence
communicated by the birds as they arrived, and to
pass it on by means of others. The note was written on
a thin slip of paper, enclosed in a very small gold box,
almost as thin as the paper itself, suspended to the neck
of the bird; the hour of arrival and departure were
marked at each successive tower, and for greater security
a duplicate was always despatched two hours after the
first. The despatches were, however, not always enclosed
in gold, but merely in paper, in which case, to prevent the
letters being defaced by damp, the legs of the pigeon
were first bathed in vinegar, with a view to keep them
cool, so that they might not settle to drink, or wash
themselves on the way, which in that hot climate they
were often doing.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIGEON-POST.</div>

<p>The modern mode of transmitting messages by pigeon-post
is much more ingenious, and less irksome to the
bird. The slip of paper is rolled up very tightly, and
inserted in a small quill, which is stitched to one of the
tail-feathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PIGEON-LIVER’D.”</div>

<p>It has been stated that the absence of a gall-bladder in
pigeons is compensated for by the extraordinary development
of the crop, by the aid of which the food becomes so
thoroughly digested, that the gall is rendered unnecessary.
This, however, is not strictly correct, as the food is only
macerated in the crop; and the gall, as it is secreted,
passes, by two ducts, from the liver into the duodenum,
instead of into a gall-bladder. Shakespeare has alluded
to this peculiarity in the digestive organs of pigeons in
<i>Hamlet</i>, where the Prince <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>The manner in which they feed their young, to which
allusion is made in <i>As You Like It</i> (Act i. Sc. 2), is very
remarkable.</p>

<p>Most birds <i>collect</i> for their young, but in the case of
pigeons and some others, there exists a provision very
similar to that of milk in quadrupeds. “I have discovered,”
says John Hunter,<a id="Marker_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="marker">106</a> “in my enquiries concerning
the various modes in which young animals are nourished,
that all the dove kind are endowed with a similar power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“AS PIGEONS FEED THEIR YOUNG.”</div>

<p>“The young pigeon, like the young quadruped, till it is
capable of digesting the common food of its kind, is fed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" title="186"> </a><!--210.png-->
with a substance secreted for that purpose by the parent
animal; not, as in the mammalia, by the female alone, but
also by the male, which perhaps furnishes this nutriment
in a degree still more abundant.</p>

<p>“It is a common property of birds, that both male and
female are equally employed in hatching and in feeding
their young in the second stage, but this particular mode
of nourishment, by means of a substance secreted in their
own bodies, is peculiar to certain kinds, and is carried on
in the crop.</p>

<p>“Besides the dove kind, I have some reason to suppose
parrots to be endowed with the same faculty, as they have
the power of throwing up the contents of the crop, and
feeding one another.</p>

<p>“I have seen the cock parrakeet regularly feed the hen,
by first filling his own crop, and then supplying her from
his beak. Parrots, macaws, cockatoos, &amp;c., when they are
very fond of the person who feeds them, may likewise be
observed to have the action of throwing up the food, and
often do it. The cock pigeon, when he caresses the hen,
performs the same kind of action as when he feeds his
young, but I do not know if at this time he throws up
anything from the crop.</p>

<p>“During incubation, the coats of the crop in the pigeon
are gradually enlarged and thickened, like what happens
to the udder of females of the class mammalia, in the
term of uterine gestation. On comparing the state of the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_187" title="187"> </a><!--211.png-->
crop when the bird is not sitting, with its appearance
during incubation, the difference is very remarkable. In
the first case it is thin and membranous, but by the time
the young are about to be hatched, the whole, except
what lies on the trachea or windpipe, becomes thickened,
and takes on a glandular appearance, having its internal
surface very irregular. It is likewise evidently more
vascular than in its former state, that it may convey a
quantity of blood, sufficient for the secretion of this substance,
which is to nourish the young brood for some days
after they are hatched. Whatever may be the consistence
of this substance when just secreted, it most probably
soon coagulates into a granulated white curd, for in such a
form I have always found it in the crop; and if an old
pigeon is killed just as the young ones are hatching, the
crop will be found as above described, and in its cavity
pieces of white curd, mixed with some of the common
food of the pigeon, such as barley, beans, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“If we allow either of the parents to feed the young, its
crop, when examined, will be discovered to contain the
same curdled substance, which passes thence into the
stomach, where it is to be digested. The young pigeon is
fed for some time with this substance only, and about the
third day some of the common food is found mingled with
it; and as the pigeon grows older, the proportion of
common food is increased, so that by the time it is seven,
eight, or nine days old, the secretion of the curd ceases in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" title="188"> </a><!--212.png-->
the old ones, and of course will no more be found in the
crop of the young.</p>

<p>“It is a curious fact that the parent pigeon has at first
the power to throw up this curd without any mixture of
common food, although afterwards both are thrown up
according to the proportion required for the young ones.
I have called this substance curd, not as being literally so,
but as resembling that more than anything I know; it
may, however, have a greater resemblance to curd than
we are perhaps aware of; for neither this secretion, nor
curd from which the whey has been pressed, seem to
contain any sugar, and do not run into the acetous
fermentation. The property of coagulating is confined to
the substance itself, as it produces no such effect when
mixed with milk. This secretion in the pigeon, like all
other animal substances, becomes putrid by standing,
though not so readily as either blood or meat, it resisting
putrefaction for a considerable time; neither will curd
much pressed become so putrid as soon as either blood or
meat.”</p>

<p>Selby says,<a id="Marker_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="marker">107</a> “The young remain in the nest till they
are able to fly, and are fed by the parent birds, who
disgorge into their mouths the food that has undergone
a maceration, or semi-digestive process, in that part of the
œsophagus usually called the crop or craw.”</p>

<p>Colonel Montagu appears to be one of the few original
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" title="189"> </a><!--213.png-->
observers who has confirmed the account given by Hunter.
“The rook,” he says, “has a small pouch under the
tongue, in which it carries food to its young. It is probable
the use of the craw may be extended further than is
generally imagined, for, besides the common preparation
of the food to assist its digestion in the stomach, there are
some species that actually secrete a lacteal substance in
the breeding season, which, mixing with the half-digested
food, is ejected to feed and nourish the young. The
mammæ from which this milky liquor is produced, are
situated on each side of the upper part of the breast,
immediately under the craw. In the female turtle-dove
we have met with these glands tumid with milky secretion,
and we believe it common to both sexes of the dove genus.”<a id="Marker_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="marker">108</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BARBARY PIGEON.</div>

<p>It is not surprising that so great an authority on the subject
as Mr. Tegetmeier should have adverted to Shakespeare’s
knowledge of these birds. At p. 133 of his work
upon Pigeons,<a id="Marker_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="marker">109</a> he says:&mdash;“The Barb, or Barbary Pigeon,
is one of those varieties whose history can be traced back
for a considerable period: it was certainly well known in
England during the sixteenth century, for Shakespeare,
in <i>As You Like It</i>, which was entered at Stationers’ Hall
in 1600, makes Rosalind, when disguised as a youth, say,
‘I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon
over his hen.’&mdash;Act iv. Sc. 1. Our intercourse with
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_190" title="190"> </a><!--214.png-->
the north of Africa was at that period not unfrequent, and
many of the domestic animals of the district had been
imported into this country. Shakespeare frequently
alludes to Barbary horses; and in the Second Part of
<i>King Henry IV.</i> Act ii. Sc. 4, makes Falstaff say, ‘He’s
no swaggerer, hostess … he’ll not swagger
with a Barbary hen, if her feathers turn back with any
show of resistance.’ This allusion was most probably to
a frizzled fowl. In this singular variety the feathers upon
the head and neck are reversed or curled, which gives the
hen at all times the appearance of a cock in fighting
attitude. Hence Shakespeare’s apt allusion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROCK-DOVE.</div>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that all the various races
of the domestic pigeon are descended from a single stock,
namely, the wild rock-pigeon (<i>Columba livia</i>). A mass
of interesting evidence on this subject will be found
in Darwin’s “Variation of Animals and Plants under
Domestication,” vol. i. chap. 5.</p>

<p>Frequent allusion has been made by Shakespeare to
the “Doves of Venus” (<i>Lucrece</i>, <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, Act i. Sc. 1), and “Venus’
Pigeons” (<i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Act ii. Sc. 6).</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOVES OF VENUS.</div>

have been wafted thither after her birth amid the waves.
The “dove of Paphos” therefore, may be considered as

<div class="sidenote">PLANTAGE.</div>

<p>An inquiry into the meaning of the word <i>plantage</i>
leads to some curious information. Archdeacon Nares
observes<a id="Marker_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="marker">110</a> that “plantage” is probably for anything that
is planted. Plants were supposed to improve as the
moon increased, and from an old book entitled “The
Profitable Art of Gardening,” by Thos. Hill, the third
edition of which was printed in 1579, we learn that
neither sowing, planting, nor grafting was ever undertaken
without a scrupulous attention to the increase
or waning of the moon. Dryden does not appear
to have understood the above passage, and has accordingly
altered it to “As true as <i>flowing tides</i> are to
the moon.” But the meaning of the original words seem
sufficiently clear, and may be fully illustrated by the
following quotation from Scott’s “Discoverie of Witchcraft”:&mdash;“The
poore husband man perceiveth that the
increase of the moone maketh plants frutiful, so as in the
full moone they are in the best strength; decaieing in

<p>It is possible that particular reference may be had to
the plant “Honesty,” or “Lunary” (<i>Lunaria</i>), which was
so named from the circular shape of its pod, which was
thought to resemble the moon (<i>Luna</i>), not only in its
form, but in its silvery brightness. The title of “Honesty”
appears to have been given it from the transparent nature
of the pod, which discovers those seed-vessels that contain
seed from such as are barren or have shed their seed.
We learn from Chaucer that “Honesty” (<i>Lunaria</i>), was
one of the plants used in incantations. Drayton calls it

<div class="sidenote">A DISH OF DOVES.</div>

<p>The custom of bestowing a pair of doves as a present

Andronicus</i>, Act iv. Sc. 4).</p>

<p>Izaak Walton tells us that “for the sacrifice of the Law
a pair of turtle-doves or young pigeons were as well
accepted as costly bulls and rams.” When Gobbo
wished to curry favour with Bassanio he began by
<span class="no-wrap">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have here a dish of doves, that I would bestow on
your worship.”&mdash;<i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2.</p>

<p>These were no doubt intended to be eaten. Paris, speaking

<blockquote>
<p>“He eats nothing but doves, love.”&mdash;<i>Troilus and

He <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The price of a pigeon at this time, as we learn from
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_197" title="197"> </a><!--221.png-->

</div>

<p>There appears to be some difference of opinion as to
what place is meant by the ancient name <i>Camelot</i>.
Selden, in his notes to Drayton’s “Polyolbion,” says:&mdash;“By
<i>South Cadbury</i> is that Camelot; a hill of a mile

betwixt every of them an earthen wall; the contents of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_199" title="199"> </a><!--223.png-->
it within about twenty acres full of ruins and relics of old
buildings.”</p>

<p>In the “History of King Arthur” (Chap. 26), Camelot
is located in the west of England, <i>Somersetshire;</i> while in
Chapter 44, it is related that Sir Balen’s sword “swam
down the stream to the citie of Camelot, that is, in
English, <i>Winchester</i>.” When Caxton finished the printing
of the “Mort d’Arthur,”<a id="Marker_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="marker">113</a> he says of the hero:&mdash;“He
is more spoken of beyond the sea, … and
yet of record remain witness of him in <i>Wales</i>, in the
town of Camelot, the great stones and marvelous
works,” &amp;c. Tennyson, in his “Mort d’Arthur,” twice
mentions Camelot, and in his “Lady of Shalott”
frequently alludes to “many-tower’d Camelot,” but in
neither poem is any clue to its precise situation
given.</p>

<p>The “wild-goose chase” above alluded to was a reckless
sort of horserace, in which two horses were started
together, and the rider who first got the lead, compelled
the other to follow him over whatever ground he
chose.<a id="Marker_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="marker">114</a></p>

<p>Burton, in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,” 1660, gives
us a general view of the sports most prevalent in the
seventeenth century, and after naming the “common
recreations of country folks,” he alludes to “riding of
great horses, running at rings, tilts and tournaments,
and <i>wild-goose chases</i>, which are disports of greater men
and good in themselves, though many gentlemen by such
means gallop quite out of their fortunes.”</p>

<p>But although the swan has no “song,” properly so
called, it has a soft and rather plaintive note, monotonous,
but not disagreeable. I have often heard it in the spring,
when swimming about with its young.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SONG OF THE SWAN.</div>

<p>Colonel Hawker, in his “Instructions to Young Sportsmen”
(11th ed. p. 269), says:&mdash;“The only note which I
ever heard the wild swan, in winter, utter, is his well-known
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_202" title="202"> </a><!--226.png-->
‘whoop.’ But one summer evening I was amused
with watching and listening to a domesticated one, as he
swam up and down the water in the Regent’s Park. He
turned up a sort of melody, made with two notes, C and
the minor third, E flat, and kept working his head as if
delighted with his own performance.</p>

<p>“The melody, taken down on the spot by a first-rate
musician, Auguste Bertini, was as <span class="no-wrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Abbé Arnaud has written some interesting remarks
upon the voice of the swan.<a id="Marker_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="marker">115</a> He <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The swan, with his wings expanded, his neck outstretched,
and his head erect, places himself opposite his
mate, uttering a cry to which the female replies by
another half a note lower. The voice of the male rises
from A (<i>la</i>), to B flat (<i>si bemol</i>); that of the female from
G sharp (<i>sol dièse</i>), to A.<a id="Marker_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="marker">116</a> The first note is short and
transient, and has the effect which our musicians term
<i>sensible;</i> so that it is not separated from the second, but
seems to glide into it. Observe that, fortunately for the
ear, they do not both sing at once; in fact, if, while the
male sounded B flat, the female gave A, or if the male
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_203" title="203"> </a><!--227.png-->
uttered A while the female gave G sharp, there would
result the harshest and most insupportable of discords.
We may add that this dialogue is subjected to a constant
and regular rhythm, with the measure of two times (?).
The keeper assured me that during their amours, these
birds have a cry still sharper, but much more agreeable.”</p>

<p>The late Charles Waterton once had an opportunity,
which rarely occurs, of seeing a swan die from natural
causes. “Although I gave no credence,” he says,<a id="Marker_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="marker">117</a> “to the
extravagant notion which antiquity had entertained of
melody from the mouth of the dying swan, still I felt
anxious to hear some plaintive sound or other, some soft
inflection of the voice, which might tend to justify that
notion in a small degree. But I was disappointed. He
nodded, and then tried to recover himself, and then
nodded again, and again held up his head; till, at last,
quite enfeebled and worn out, his head fell gently on the
grass, his wings became expanded a trifle or so, and he
died whilst I was looking on. He never even uttered his
wonted cry, nor so much as a sound to indicate what he
felt within.</p>

<p>“The silence which this bird maintained to the last
tends to show that the dying song of the swan is nothing
but a fable, the origin of which is lost in the shades of
antiquity. Its repetition can be of no manner of use,
save as a warning to ornithologists not to indulge in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_204" title="204"> </a><!--228.png-->
extravagancies of romance&mdash;a propensity not altogether
unknown in these our latter times.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HABITS OF THE SWAN.</div>

<p>Yarrell has remarked, in his “History of British Birds,”
that “the young, when hatched, which is generally about
the end of May, are conducted to the water by the
parent bird, and are even said to be carried there: it is
certain that the cygnets are frequently carried on the
back of the female when she is sailing about in the water.
This I have witnessed on the Thames, and have seen the
female, by raising her leg, assist the cygnets in getting
upon her back.” Mr. Jesse, also, in his “Gleanings in
Natural History,” correctly observes: “Where the stream
is strong the old swan will sink herself sufficiently low
to bring her back on a level with the water, when the
cygnets will get upon it, and in this manner are conveyed
to the other side of the river, or into stiller water.”</p>

that this habit had been noticed by <span class="no-wrap">Shakespeare:&mdash;</span></p>

Durham, speaking of the habits of the horned grebe
(<i>Podiceps cornutus</i>), as observed by him in Iceland, says:&mdash;“One
day, having seen one of these birds dive from its
nest, I placed myself with my gun at my shoulder, waiting
its reappearance. As soon as it emerged I fired and killed
it, and was surprised to see two young ones, which it
seems had been concealed beneath the wings of the parent
bird, drop upon the water. I afterwards shot several other
birds of this species, all of which dived with their young
under their wings. The young were placed with their
heads towards the tail, and their bills resting on the back
of the parent bird.”</p>

CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE GAME-BIRDS AND “QUARRY” FLOWN AT BY
FALCONERS.</span></h2>


<p>GAME-PRESERVING, as we now understand the term,
was probably unknown in Shakespeare’s days, for
sportsmen at that time had not the means of making such
large bags, and consequently the necessity for breeding and
rearing game artificially did not exist. Nature’s liberal
supply sufficed to satisfy the moderate demand, and the
sportsman always returned home well pleased. We
take it, however, that this satisfaction resulted more from
an appreciation of sport than from the possession of a
heavy bag. What more enjoyable than the pursuit of
partridges, “with grey gos-hawk in hand,” as Chaucer
hath it, or a flight at heron with a falcon?</p>

<p>The skill, too, which was required to kill a bird or
rabbit with a single bolt from a cross-bow was far greater
than that which is needed to achieve the same result
with an ounce of shot from a breech-loader. Not that
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_210" title="210"> </a><!--234.png-->
guns were unknown in Shakespeare’s day, for the old-fashioned
“birding-piece” was then in use, as we have
already noticed.<a id="Marker_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="marker">118</a> But, partly in consequence of its
inferiority and cost, and partly because its use was so
little understood, the majority of folks preferred to carry
a weapon with which they were more skilled, and on
which they could consequently place more reliance.
Gradually, as the fowling-piece became more and more
perfect, the long-bow and cross-bow were laid aside, and
hawking became almost forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PHEASANT:</div>

<p>Notwithstanding that the Pheasant (<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>)
must have been well-known in Shakespeare’s day, the poet
has only once made mention of this bird. The passage
occurs in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, Act iv. Sc. 3, and runs <span class="no-wrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<i class="speaker">Shepherd.</i> My business, sir, is to the king.</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Autolycus.</i> What advocate hast thou to him?</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Shepherd.</i> I know not, an ’t like you.</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Clown (jokingly aside to Shepherd).</i> Advocate’s the

<p><i class="speaker">Autolycus.</i> How blessed are we that are not simple
men!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS INTRODUCTION INTO BRITAIN.</div>

<p>The precise date of the introduction of the pheasant
into Great Britain is uncertain, but there is evidence to
show that it was prior to the invasion of the Normans,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_211" title="211"> </a><!--235.png-->
and that we are probably indebted for this game-bird to
the enterprise of the Romans. The earliest record, we
believe, of the occurrence of the pheasant in this country
will be found in the tract “De inventione Sanctæ Crucis
nostræ in Monte Acuto et de ductione ejusdem apud
Waltham,” edited by Prof. Stubbs from manuscripts in
the British Museum, and published in 1861.<a id="Marker_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="marker">119</a> In one of

<p>In a survey of the possessions of the Abbey of
Glastonbury made in 1539, mention is made of <i>a “game”
of sixteen pheasants</i> in the woods at Meare, a manor
near Glastonbury belonging to the Abbey.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_215" title="215"> </a><!--239.png-->

<div class="sidenote">GAME-LAWS.</div>

<p>According to Fynes Morrison (“Itinerary,” 1617), there
was in Ireland “such plenty of <i>pheasants</i> as I have known
readie served at one feast.”</p>

<p>The value set upon pheasants and partridges at various
periods, as shown by the laws fixing penalties for their
destruction, seems to have fluctuated considerably.</p>

<p>By a statute passed in the eleventh year of the reign
of Henry VII. it was forbidden “to take pheasants or
partridges with engines in another’s ground without license
in pain of ten pound, to be divided between the owner of
the ground and the prosecutor.” By 23 Eliz. c. 10, “None
should kill or take pheasants or partridges by night in
pain of 20<i>s.</i> a pheasant, and 10<i>s.</i> a partridge, or one
month’s imprisonment, and bound with sureties not
to offend again in the like kind.” By 1 Jac. I. c. 27, “No
person should kill or take any pheasant, partridge, (&amp;c.),
or take or destroy the eggs of pheasants, partridges, (&amp;c.),
in pain of 20<i>s.</i>, or imprisonment for every fowl or egg,
and to find sureties in £20 not to offend in the like kind.”
Under the same statute, no person was permitted “to
buy or sell any pheasant or partridge, upon pain to forfeit
20<i>s.</i> for every pheasant, and 10<i>s.</i> for every partridge.”
By 7 Jac. I. c. 11, “every person having hawked at or
destroyed any pheasant or partridge between the 1st of
July and last of August, forfeited 40<i>s.</i> for every time so
hawking, and 20<i>s.</i> for every pheasant or partridge so
destroyed or taken.” Lords of manors and their servants
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_216" title="216"> </a><!--240.png-->
might take pheasants or partridges in their own grounds
or precincts in the day-time between Michaelmas and
Christmas. But every person of a mean condition having
killed or taken any pheasant or partridge, forfeited 20<i>s.</i>
for each one so killed, and had to find surety in £20
not to offend so again.</p>

<p>In some of these old statutes, however, it was expressly
stated that although pheasants and partridges could not
be killed by any one with impunity, no penalty should
attach for killing such birds as crows, kites, and buzzards,
as these were well known to be destructive to the game
which the statutes were framed to protect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PARTRIDGE.</div>

<p>In the second part of <i>Henry VI.</i> Act iii. Sc. 2, we find
the Partridge (<i>Perdix cinerea</i>) appropriately placed by
Shakespeare in the nest of the <span class="no-wrap">kite:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Who finds the partridge in the puttock’s nest,</div>
<div class="line">But may imagine how the bird was dead,</div>
<div class="line">Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Henry VI.</i> Part II. Act iii. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>Such was the beautiful metaphor uttered by the Earl
of Warwick upon the occasion of the Duke of Gloucester’s
death. The unfortunate Duke was discovered dead in his
bed, with marks of violence upon his features, and grave
suspicion fell upon the Duke of Suffolk, who “had him in
protection.” This circumstance, coupled with the fact that
Suffolk was a sworn enemy of Duke Humphrey, placed a
heavy weight in the balance against him.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_217" title="217"> </a><!--241.png-->

<div class="sidenote">PARTRIDGE-HAWKING.</div>

<p>The provincial name of “puttock,” which occurs in the
above quotation, is sometimes applied to the kite, sometimes
to the common buzzard. In this case, as shown by
the context, the kite is the bird referred to. A greater
enemy to the partridge than either of these birds is the
peregrine, whose skill in taking this game was early
turned to advantage by falconers. Partridge-hawking was
formerly a favourite pastime, and is still, to a certain extent,
with those few who still maintain the practice of
falconry. For this sport either the peregrine or the goshawk
may be used. Aubrey has recorded a curious event which
happened when he was a freshman at Oxford in 1642.
He frequently supped with Charles I., who then resided at
the University; and on one of these occasions he heard
the King say that&mdash;“As he was hawking in Scotland, he
rode into the quarry, and found the covey of partridges
falling upon the hawk.” He adds that the King said&mdash;“I
will swear upon the book that it is true.” Mr. F.&nbsp;H. Salvin
has been very successful in taking pheasants with the male
goshawk, which he found required no “entering,” but flew
and killed even old cocks, threading his way through the
trees in a wonderfully rapid manner.<a id="Marker_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="marker">123</a></p>

<p>Those who made their living by fowling, and could not
afford to hawk, took their birds by springe and net; and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_218" title="218"> </a><!--242.png-->
partridge-netting was, perhaps, as much in vogue in
Shakespeare’s day as now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARTRIDGE-NETTING.</div>

<p>In <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, allusion is again made to
the partridge by Beatrice, who, referring to the ill-humour
of Benedick, <span class="no-wrap">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He’ll but break a comparison or two on me; which,
peradventure, not marked or not laughed at, strikes him
into melancholy; and then there’s a partridge wing saved,
for the fool will eat no supper that night.”&mdash;<i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, Act ii. Sc. 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we speak of a “covey” of partridges, so we say a
“bevy” of <span class="no-wrap">quails:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“And many more of the same bevy.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act v. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUAIL.</div>

<p>It was formerly the practice to keep Quails, and make
them fight like game-cocks. Solon directed that quails
should be made to fight in the presence of the Athenian
youths, in order to inflame their courage, and the Romans
held quail-fighting in still higher estimation. Augustus
punished a prefect of Egypt with death for buying and
bringing to table a quail which had acquired celebrity by
its victories.<a id="Marker_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="marker">124</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare was doubtless alluding to this sport when
he <span class="no-wrap">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_219" title="219"> </a><!--243.png-->

<blockquote>
<p><!--TN: added open quote-->“Here’s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and
one that loves quails.”&mdash;<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act v. Sc. 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even at the present day this sort of amusement is
common in some parts of Italy, and still more so in
China. In Italy, the practice is to feed up two quails
very highly, and then place them opposite to each other at
the end of a long table, throwing between them a few
grains of millet-seed to make them quarrel. At first they
merely threaten, lowering the head and ruffling all the neck
feathers, but at length they rush on furiously, striking with
their bills, erecting their heads, and rising upon their spurs,
until one is forced to yield.</p>

<p>In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> (Act ii. Sc. 3), Antonius says of
<span class="no-wrap">Cæsar:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“His cocks do win the battle still of mine,</div>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">QUAIL-FIGHTING.</div>

<p>That there was some foundation for this assertion, we
may gather from the following extract from North’s
<span class="no-wrap">“Plutarch”:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“With Antonius there was a soothsayer or astronomer
in Egypt that coulde cast a figure and judge of men’s
nativities, to tell them what should happen to them. He
told Antonius plainly that his fortune (which of itself was
excellent good and very great) was altogether blemished
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_220" title="220"> </a><!--244.png-->
and obscured by Cæsar’s fortune; and therefore he counselled
him utterly to leave his company, and get him as
farre from him as he coulde. Howsoever it was, the event
ensuing proved the Egyptian’s words true; for it is said
that as often as they drew lots for pastime, who should
have anything, or whether they played at dice, Antonius
always lost. <i>Oftentimes when they were disposed to see cock-fights,
or quails that were taught to fight one with another,
Cæsar’s cocks or quails did ever overcome.</i> The which
spited Antonius in his mind, although he made no outward
show of it, and therefore he believed the Egyptian
the better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Kircher’s “Musurgia” the note of this bird is thus
faithfully rendered<span class="no-wrap"><a id="Marker_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="marker">125</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Quails have always been considered a delicacy for the
table, and those who may have the curiosity to visit the
London markets in the spring of the year, will see large
boxes full of live quails, which have been taken in nets
and imported to this country for food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAPWING.</div>

<p>In the same way immense numbers of Lapwings
(<i>Vanellus cristatus</i>), or Green Plovers, as they are called,
find their way into the London markets. This bird has
been noticed by Shakespeare chiefly on account of a
peculiar trait in its character, with which most naturalists
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_221" title="221"> </a><!--245.png-->
are very familiar. Like the partridge and some other
birds, it has a curious habit of trying to draw intruders
away from its nest or young by fluttering along the
ground in an opposite direction, or by feigning lameness,
or uttering melancholy cries at a <span class="no-wrap">distance:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“Far from her nest the lapwing cries away.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Comedy of Errors</i>, Act iv. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>Allusions to this habit are not unfrequent in our older
poets. Lily, in his “Campaspe,” 1584, <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You resemble the lapwing, who crieth most where her
nest is not.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So also Greene, in the second part of his “Coney
Catching,” <span class="no-wrap">1592:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“But again to our priggers, who, as before</div>
<div class="line">I said, cry with the lapwing farthest from her nest.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in Ben Jonson’s <i>Underwoods</i> we are <span class="no-wrap">told,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Where he that knows will like a lapwing flie,</div>
<div class="line">Farre from the nest, and so himselfe belie.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hence the phrase “to seem the lapwing,” which occurs in
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, Act i. Sc. 4. So also in <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs,</div>
<div class="line">Close by the ground, to hear our conference.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Act iii. Sc. 1.</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_222" title="222"> </a><!--246.png-->

<p>It is rather curious that Shakespeare has not alluded to
this bird under its popular name of “Peewit,”&mdash;a name
which, derived from its cry, we believe to be of some
antiquity. Nor has he referred to it by another name,
which must have been commonly applied to it in his day,
<i>i.e.</i>, “Wype.” In the old “Household Books” and “Privy
Purse Expenses,” we frequently meet with such entries as
the <span class="no-wrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Item, it is thought goode that wypes<a id="Marker_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="marker">126</a> be hade for my
Lordes own mees onely and to be at jd. a pece.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The young of this, and many other, species run almost
as soon as hatched, and Shakespeare has not overlooked
this <span class="no-wrap">peculiarity:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem stanza">
<div class="line">“This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Hamlet</i>, Act v. Sc. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>We have before had occasion to make a passing allusion
to the Heron, and in the present chapter this bird deserves
more particular attention, from the fact of its being so
frequently flown at by falconers.</p>

<p>Hawking at herons was thought to be “a marvellous
and delectable pastime,” and in all the published treatises
upon falconry, many pages are dedicated to this particular
branch of the sport.</p>

<p>Not only were herons protected by Act of Parliament,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_223" title="223"> </a><!--247.png-->
but penalties were incurred for taking the eggs,<a id="Marker_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="marker">127</a> and no
one was permitted to shoot within 600 paces of a heronry,
under a penalty of £20 (7 Jac. I. c. 27).</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HERNSHAW.</div>

<p>We should scarcely have thought it possible to find a
man who would not know a hawk from a heron when he
saw it, and Hamlet evidently considered that such an one

<p>He referred here to an old proverbial saying, originally
“he does not know a hawk from a hernshaw,” that is, a

<div class="sidenote">HERON-HAWKING.</div>

<p>John Shaw (M.A., of Cambridge), who published a
curious book in 1635, entitled “Speculum Mundi,” tells us
therein that “the heron or <i>hernsaw</i> is a large fowle that
liveth about waters,” and that “hath a marvellous hatred
to the hawk, which hatred is duly returned. When they
fight above in the air, they labour both especially for this
one thing&mdash;that one may ascend and be above the other.
Now, if the hawk getteth the upper place, he overthroweth
and vanquisheth the heron with a marvellous earnest
flight.” This old passage contrasts quaintly with the
animated description of heron-hawking in Freeman and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_224" title="224"> </a><!--248.png-->
Salvin’s modern treatise.<a id="Marker_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="marker">128</a> Those who have taken part in
the sport cannot fail to be interested in a truthful narrative
of what they must so often have witnessed; while
those who have never seen a trained falcon on the wing
will learn a good deal from the following excellent <span class="no-wrap">description:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘Well, then, here goes,’ says the falconer; and having
let the heron get a little past, off go the hoods. For a
moment one hawk looks up, and is cast off; the other a
moment or two afterwards. They both see him; now for
a flight. The heron was about 250 yards high, and
perhaps a quarter of a mile wide. The hawks had gone
up about a quarter of the way before the heron saw them
in hot pursuit. ‘Now he sees them!’ is exclaimed; and
the riders rattle their horses as hard as they can, over deep
sand-hills, down wind. The heron, in the meanwhile,
vomits up his fish to lighten himself, and begins ringing-up
down wind. It is a curious thing to see the different
manœuvres of the birds. With his large wings, the heron
can mount very fair, and has a far better chance of beating
off the hawks than if he flew straight forward. This he
knows full well by instinct, and puts on accordingly all
sail for the upper regions, generally in short rings.
Hawks make larger rings as a general rule, if, like these,
they are good ones. Those have but a bad chance with a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_225" title="225"> </a><!--249.png-->
good heron if they adopt the same tactics that he does in
mounting. This the two old hawks know full well. So
far they have been pretty near together, but, seeing the
prey beginning to mount, they separate, each their own
way, now taking a long turn down wind, and then
breasting the wind again. ‘De Ruyter’ makes the best
rings, and after having gone a mile, there is a shout&mdash;‘Now
“De Ruyter” is above him!’ and the hawk is seen
poising herself for a stoop; down she comes, with closed
wings, like a bullet, and hits the heron; it is too high
to see <i>where</i>, but the scream the quarry gives is
tremendous. Hurrah! there’s a stoop for you! Both
hawk and heron have descended some yards; the former,
from the impetus of her stoop, much beneath the heron,
but she shoots up again to a level. In fact, it was a perfect
stoop. Though so near the heron, she does not attempt a
<i>little</i> stoop, but again heads the wind so that the heron
appears to be flying the hawk. ‘Sultan’ is now above
both, and makes her stoop, but not so good as her partner’s.
However, she makes two quickly, and is within an ace
of catching; but the good heron will not give an inch,
and ‘Sultan’ will have to give another ring for another
stoop. But where is ‘De Ruyter’ all this time? She
has made a long ring, and is now a long way above
them. She makes another full stoop, and this time there
is no mistake about it, for she hits the heron so hard that
he is nearly stupefied. ‘Sultan’ joins in the fray and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_226" title="226"> </a><!--250.png-->
catches. Whoo-whoo-o-p! down they come. Down they
all three go together, till, just before reaching the ground,
the two old hawks let go of their prey, which falls bump.
Before he has had time to recover himself, in a moment
the hawks are on him, ‘De Ruyter’ on the neck, and
‘Sultan’ on his body. Hurrah for the gallant hawks! and
loud whoops proclaim his capture. ‘Wouldn’t take £100
for them,’ says their owner, who has ridden well, judiciously
as well as hard, and has got up in time to save the heron’s
life. He gives the hawks a pigeon, and puts the heron
between his knees in a position so that he can neither
spike him nor the hawks with his bill. He has two
beautiful long black feathers, which are duly presented to
Prince Alexander&mdash;alas! now no more&mdash;who is well up
at the take. These feathers are the badge of honour
in heron-hawking in Holland, as the fox’s brush is in
hunting in England. The hawks are fed up as speedily as
possible, the heron has a ring put round his leg, and is let
loose, evidently not knowing what to make of it.</p>

<p>“We hasten back as fast as we can, but the weather
being now hot, the herons move more by night than by
day. Many anxious eyes search the horizon for another.</p>

<p>“The two sets of falconers, with their hawks, place themselves
about half a mile apart, to intercept the herons on
their passage back from their fishing-grounds.</p>

<p>“There is no lack of herons. The little wind there was
has fallen to a calm, and they come home higher. All the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_227" title="227"> </a><!--251.png-->
better, for we have some good casts to fly. One is soon
‘hooded off’ at, and, after a capital flight, is taken high in
the air. The pet hawks are now taken in hand&mdash;‘De
Ruyter’ and ‘Sultan;’ and, as there is no wind, the owner
says he will fly at the first ‘<i>light one</i>,’ that comes at all
fair. All is excitement when one is seen coming <i>from</i> the
<i>heronry</i>, and therefore unweighted. They are ‘hooded off’
in his face; he sees them directly, and proceeds to mount.
‘Now, good hawks, you will have some work to do before
you overtake him!’ The knowing riders are down wind as
hard as they can go. Ring after ring is made, and yet the
hawks seem to gain but little on him. Still they are
flying like swallows: ‘De Ruyter’ makes a tremendous
ring, but still fails to get above him. Again and again they
ring, and have attained a great height. A scream of delight
is heard: they are above him; ‘De Ruyter’ is at him!
A fine stoop, but the heron dodges out of the way. Now
for ‘Sultan;’ but she misses too; the heron is up like a
shot, and three or four rings have to be made before there
is another stoop. Another and another stoop, with loud
cheers from below. ‘Sultan’ <i>just</i> catches him once, but
can’t hold; it seems still a doubtful victory, when ‘De
Ruyter’ hits him <i>hard;</i> and, after two or three more
stoops, ‘Sultan’ catches him, amidst the excitement
of hurrahs and whoops; a really good flight; <i>can’t be
better</i>,&mdash;two and a half miles from where they were
‘hooded off.’</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_228" title="228"> </a><!--252.png-->

<p>“Thus ended as good a day’s sport as any one could wish
to see.”</p>

<p>The heron, besides affording great sport with hawks, was
considered, when killed, a delicacy for the table. At the
ancient City feasts and entertainments to royalty, the heron
always appeared amongst the other good things;<a id="Marker_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="marker">129</a> and from
the old “Household Books” it appears that the price usually
paid for this bird was xijd. Of late years the heron has
dropped out of the bill of fare, and no longer forms a
fashionable dish. One of the last records of its appearance
at table which we have met with, is in connection with the
feast which was given by the Executors of Thomas Sutton,
the founder of the London Charter House, on the 18th May,
1812, in the Hall of the Stationers’ Company. “For this
repast were provided 32 neats’ tongues, 40 stone of beef,
24 marrow-bones, 1 lamb, 46 capons, 32 geese, 4 pheasants,
12 pheasants’ pullets, 12 godwits, 24 rabbits, 6 <i>hearnshaws</i>,”

<p>Mr. A.&nbsp;E. Knox, in his “Game-Birds and Wild-Fowl,” has
described a very similar trap, and his description is so
animated, while at the same time so instructive, that we
are tempted to overlook the similarity and quote his
<span class="no-wrap">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We soon found many tracks of the woodcock on the
black mud; and on one spot these, as well as the borings
of his beak, were very numerous. Here my companion
halted, and pulling out his knife, cut down a tall willow
rod, which he stuck firmly into the ground in nearly an
upright position, or perhaps rather inclining backwards.</p>

<p>“On the opposite side of the run he fixed a peg, so as to
project only a few inches above the surface; to this he
fastened a slight stick about a foot long, attached loosely
with a tough string, much as the swingel of a flail is to its
handstaff: another branch of a willow was bent into an
arch, and both ends driven into the soft ground to a considerable
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_231" title="231"> </a><!--255.png-->
depth on the opposite side of the track, and nearer
to the tall upright wand. To the top of the latter a string
was now fastened, the end of which was formed into a
large running noose; while, about half way down, another
piece of stick, about six inches long, was tied by its
middle. The flexible wand was then bent forcibly downwards,
one end of the little stick overhead was passed
under the arch, while it was retained in this position, and
at the same time the bow prevented from springing
upwards, by the other extremity being placed against a
notch at the end of the stick which had been fastened to
the peg on the other side of the run, across which it now
lay, two or three inches from the ground, and supported
the noose. This, in fact, constituted the trigger, which was
to be released when struck by the breast of the woodcock.
The old man constructed his trap in much less time than
I have taken to describe it. His last care was to weave
the sedges on either side of the run into a kind of screen,
so as to <i>weir</i> the woodcock into the snare, and this he
accomplished with much skill and expedition.”</p>

<p>Under the head of “Wild-Fowl” we shall have occasion,
in a subsequent chapter, to allude to the opinion of
Pythagoras on the transmigration of souls, and to the

<blockquote>
<p>“Fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul

</blockquote>

<p>The “woodcock’s head” in Shakespeare’s day, on account
of its shape, was a fashionable term for a tobacco-pipe.<a id="Marker_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="marker">130</a>
“Those who loved smoking sat on the stage-stools, with
their three sorts of tobacco, and their lights by them,
handing matches on the point of their swords, or sending
out their pages for real Trinidado. They actually practised
smoking under professors who taught them tricks; and
the intelligence offices were not more frequented, no, nor
the pretty seamstresses’ shops at the Exchange, than the
new tobacco office.”<a id="Marker_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="marker">131</a></p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that while Shakespeare’s
contemporary, Ben Jonson, has founded whole scenes upon
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_233" title="233"> </a><!--257.png-->
the practice of smoking, he himself has made no mention
of it. Some commentators have brought this forward as a
proof of the comparative earliness of many of his dramas,
but smoking was in general use long before Shakespeare
left London, and he drew his manners almost entirely from
his own age, making mention of masks, false hair, pomanders,
and fardingales, all of which were introduced about
the same time. But <i>apropos</i> of “the woodcock’s head,”
we are wandering away from Shakespeare’s birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SNIPE.</div>

<p>The Snipe (<i>Scolopax gallinago</i>) has been less frequently
noticed by him than the woodcock. Indeed we have been
unable to find more than one passage in which it is
mentioned.</p>

<p>Iago, alluding to Roderigo, <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“For I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane,</div>
<div class="line">If I would time expend with such a snipe,</div>
<div class="line">But for my sport and profit.”</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution"><i>Othello</i>, Act i. Sc. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>The speaker being evidently of opinion that a snipe was
too insignificant a bird to the sportsman to warrant his
taking much trouble to kill it, except for mere sport.</p>

<p>That there was a good deal more “sport” than “profit”
is extremely likely; for it is difficult to believe that the
sportsmen of Shakespeare’s day, with guns such as we
have described, fired with either fuze or flint, could have
successfully stopped the erratic flight of a snipe. That
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_234" title="234"> </a><!--258.png-->
large numbers of snipe were brought to market, and
appeared at table, in Shakespeare’s time, is clear from the
numerous entries in the old “Household Book,” where
their value is stated to have been “after iii a j d.” There
can be little doubt, however, that these were not “shot
birds,” but were taken in snares and nets, as our modern
fowlers take plovers and other fen birds.</p>

<span class="smaller">WILD-FOWL AND SEA-FOWL.</span></h2>


<p>TO the general reader these terms may appear
synonymous, but to the sportsman and naturalist
they have a very different signification. Under the
head of “wild-fowl” may be placed the various species
of wild geese, swans, and ducks, which, though often
found at sea, evince a partiality for fresh water, rear
their young in the neighbourhood of fresh water, and, as
an article of food, are especially sought after by the
amateur for sport, and by the professional gunner for profit;
while the group of “sea-fowl” may be said to include
the gulls, terns, guillemots, auks, cormorants, and various
other birds, which, making the sea their home, rear their
young upon its shelving beach or frowning cliffs, and,
except on an emergency, are seldom cooked and eaten.</p>

<p>Naturalists have frequently observed that when any of
the diving-ducks are winged or injured, they generally
make for the open water, and endeavour to escape by
diving or swimming away, while those which do not

the grass that grows therein. You must shelter yourself
and gun behind his fore-shoulder, bending your body
down low by his side, and keeping his body still full
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_239" title="239"> </a><!--263.png-->
between you and the fowl. Being within shot, take your
level from before the fore part of the horse, shooting as
it were between the horse’s neck and the water.…
Now to supply the want of a stalking-horse, which will
take up a great deal of time to instruct and make fit for
this exercise, you may make one of any piece of old
canvass, which you must shape into the form of an horse,
with the head bending downwards, as if he grazed. You
may stuff it with any light matter; and do not forget to
paint it of the color of an horse, of which the brown is
the best.… It must be made so portable that
you may bear it with ease in one hand, moving it so as
it may seem to graze as you go.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the stalking-horse was made in shape of an
ox; sometimes in the form of a stag; and sometimes to
represent a tree, shrub, or bush. In every case it had a
spike at the bottom, to stick into the ground while the
fowler took his aim.</p>

<p>In the “Privy Purse Expenses of King Henry VIII.”
are various entries referring to stalking-horses, all of
which appear to refer to the live animal; and there is one
entry relating to a stalking-ox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CALIVER.</div>

<p>The gun used on these occasions was either the
“birding-piece” already described,<a id="Marker_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="marker">134</a> or the “caliver.”
Shakespeare has appropriately mentioned the latter in
connection with wild ducks, in the first part of his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_240" title="240"> </a><!--264.png-->
<i>Henry IV.</i>, where Falstaff speaks of cowards “such as
fear the report of a ‘caliver’ worse than a struck fowl or
a hurt wild-duck.”&mdash;<i>Henry IV.</i> Part I. Act iv. Sc. 2.</p>

<p>The derivation of the word “caliver” is not quite clear,
unless it be the same weapon as the “culverin,” in which
case it may be derived from the French <i>couleuvrin</i>, adder-like.
In Cotgrave’s French and English Dictionary, 1660,
the word is spelled “calœver,” and translated “harquebuse.”
In Bailey’s “Dictionarium Britannicum,” 1736,
the caliver is described as “a small gun used at sea.” In
Worcester’s “Dictionary of the English Language,” 1859,
“caliver” is said to be corrupted from <i>caliber</i>, and described
as&mdash;1. a hand-gun or large pistol, an arquebuse;
2. a kind of light matchlock. In Scheler’s “Dictionnaire
d’Etymologie Française,” 1862, we find&mdash;“couleuvre du
L. <i>colubra;</i> It. <i>colubro;</i> Prov. <i>colobre;</i> du L. masc. <i>coluber</i>,
<i>bri;</i> D. <i>couleuvreau</i>, <i>couleuvrine</i>, ou <i>coulevrine</i>, pièce d’artillerie;
cp. les termes <i>serpentin</i>, et All. <i>feldschlange</i>.”</p>

<p>From these various explanations, as well as from that
given by Archdeacon Nares in his “Glossary,” it would
seem to have been a military rather than a sporting
weapon. The best description which we have met with is
that given by Sir S.&nbsp;D. Scott.<a id="Marker_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="marker">135</a> He <span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Caliver was a kind of short musket or harquebus,
fired by a matchlock, and from its lightness did not require
a rest.”</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_241" title="241"> </a><!--265.png-->

<p>“‘Put me a caliver in Wart’s hands,’ says Falstaff,
reviewing his recruits, meaning thereby that Wart, who
was a weak, undersized fellow, was not capable of managing
a heavier weapon. It was sometimes called <i>arquebuse
de calibre</i>, and was in fact an arquebus of specified bore,
having derived its name from the corruption of calibre
into caliver. ‘I remember,’ writes Edmund York, an
officer who had served in the Netherlands, and was appointed
by the Privy Council to report on the best mode
of organizing the militia of London, in expectation of the
Spanish invasion, ‘when I was first brought up in Piemount,
in the Countie of Brisack’s Regiment of the old
Bandes, we had our particular calibre of Harquebuze to
our Regiment, both that for one bullett should serve all the
harquebuses of our Regiment, as for that our Collonell
would not be deceaved of his armes; of which worde
Calibre, came first that unapt term we used to call a harquebuze
a calliver, which is the height of the bullett, and
not of the piece. Before the battell of Mountgunter
(<i>Moncontour</i>, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1569) the Prynces of the Religion
caused seven thousand harquebuzes to be made, all of one
calibre, which were called <i>Harquebuze du calibre de Monsieur
le Prince</i>. So as, I think, some man not understanding
French brought hither the name of the height of the
bullet of the piece; which worde calibre is yet contynued
with our good cannoniers.’”<a id="Marker_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="marker">136</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_242" title="242"> </a><!--266.png-->

<p>A contemporary military writer, Sir John Smythe, gives
his opinion that the term was derived from “the height of
the bullet”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the bore. He says, “The caliver is only a
harquebuse; savinge, that it is of greater circuite, or bullet,
than the other is of; wherefore the Frenchman doth call it a
<i>piece de calibre</i>, which is as much as to saie, a piece of bigger
circuite.<a id="Marker_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="marker">137</a> I would that all harquebuses throughout the field
should be of one caliver and height, to the intent that every
soldier on the lack of bullets might use his fellows’ bullets.”</p>

<p>There are two specimens in the Tower Collection, of a
caliver and a musket of the sixteenth century, from
Penshurst Place, Kent. The length of the former (here
figured) is 4 ft. 10 in., the latter 5 ft. 5¼ in.<a id="Marker_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="marker">138</a></p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the “bigger circuite,” the musket was
considered twice as efficient in its effects, and Sir Roger
Williams corroborates the fact, admitting the advantage
possessed by the caliver of being more rapidly discharged.
“The calivers may say they will discharge two shot for
one, but cannot denie that one musket-shot doth more hurt
than two calivers’ shot.”<a id="Marker_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="marker">139</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_243" title="243"> </a><!--267.png-->

<p>In the <i>Lancashire Lieutenancy</i> is preserved the price of
the caliver and its appendages, and the equipment of the
bearer, in 1574:&mdash;“Everie caliū his peece, flaxe &amp; touche-box

coate xij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup>, money in his purse xxvj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d</sup>.”</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, the price of a caliver,
which, with flask and touch-box, was charged only 14<i>s.</i> in
1574, in 1576 cost <span class="no-wrap">24<i>s.:</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It will readily be understood by all sportsmen, that with
such a weapon as the “caliver,” much practice and
patience must have been requisite to bring it within range
of the fowl, and use it with effect. The successful use of
a modern punt-gun necessitates an amount of skill and
judgment which those only who have tried it can really
appreciate. How much greater must have been the
difficulties of the wild-fowler of the sixteenth century,
whose rude gun and inferior powder necessitated a much
nearer approach to the birds! We can sympathize with

<div class="sidenote">THE STALE.</div>

<p>The wild-fowler who could not succeed in “stalking”
and shooting the birds in the way we have described,
often employed another method of securing them, namely,
by means of “a stale,” as it was termed. This was a
stuffed bird of the species the fowler wished to decoy, and
which was set up in as natural a position as possible, either
before a net or in the midst of several “springes.” By
imitating the call of the passing birds, the fowler would
draw their attention to the “stale,” and as soon as they
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_245" title="245"> </a><!--269.png-->
alighted near it either the net was pulled over them, or
they were caught in the snares.</p>

<p>Beaumont and Fletcher speak of “stales to catch kites”
(<i>Hum. Lieut.</i> iii. 2). Sometimes a live bird was pegged
down instead of a stuffed one, and was doubtless much
more effective, since “one bird caught, served <i>as a stale</i> to
bring in more.”<a id="Marker_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="marker">144</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare has employed the word “stale” in this
its primary sense, in his <i>Comedy of Errors</i> (Act ii. Sc. 1),
in <i>The Tempest</i> (Act iv. Sc. 1), and in the <i>Taming of
the Shrew</i> (Act iii. Sc. 1). But commentators do not
seem to be agreed on its meaning. In Act i. Sc. 1, of the
last-mentioned play, where it occurs again, it certainly
admits of a different interpretation.</p>

<p>Instructions for making a “stale” will be found in
“The Experienced Fowler” (London, 1704). At page 18
of this curious little volume, the author says:&mdash;“You may
shoot a lark or some other bird, take out the entrails, stuff
him with tow, and dry him in an oven, his wings set in a
flying posture; and so you may be furnished at all times.”
This device was chiefly resorted to for taking the ruff
and reeve, and other fen birds, which fetched good prices
for the table. Now-a-days, the bird-catchers who take
linnets, goldfinches, and other small songsters, almost
invariably peg down live decoy birds with a foot or so
of string to the legs, in the centre of a pair of clap-nets.</p>

the metamorphosis in the following <span class="no-wrap">line:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is strange that in matters concerning the marvellous,
even men of education will take pains to deceive themselves,
and, instead of investigating nature with a “learned
spirit,” give a license to ill-directed imagination, and credit
absurdities. When such men are so credulous, how can
we wonder at the superstitions of the illiterate?</p>

<p>The first phase of the story in question is, that certain
trees, resembling willows, more particularly in one of the
Orkneys, Pomona, produced at the ends of their branches
small swelled balls, containing the embryo of a goose
suspended by the bill, which, when ripe, fell off into the
sea and took wing.</p>

<div class="caption">THE BARNACLE GOOSE.</div>
</div>

<p>So long ago as the twelfth century, the story was promulgated
by Giraldus Cambrensis, in his “Topographia
Hiberniæ,” and Munster, Saxo Grammaticus, Scaliger,
Fulgosus, Bishop Leslie, and Olaus Magnus, all attested to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_248" title="248"> </a><!--272.png-->
the truth of this monstrous absurdity. Gesner, too, and
Aldrovandus<a id="Marker_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="marker">146</a> may be also cited.</p>

<div class="caption">THE BARNACLE GOOSE TREE. <i>From Aldrovandus.</i></div>
</div>

<p>A second phase or modification of the story is that
given by Boëce, the oldest Scottish historian: he denies
that the geese (Scotticè, Claiks) grow on trees by their
bills, as some believe, but that, as his own researches and
personal experience prove, they are first produced in the
form of worms, in the substance of old trees or timber
floating in the sea; for such a tree, cast on shore in 1480,
was brought to the laird, who ordered it to be sawn
asunder, when there appeared a multitude of worms,
“throwing themselves out of sundry holes and bores of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_249" title="249"> </a><!--273.png-->
the tree; some of them were rude, as they were new-shapen;
some had both head, feet, and wings, but they
had no feathers; some of them were perfect-shapen fowls.
At last the people, having this tree each day in more
admiration, brought it to the kirk of St. Andrew’s, beside
the town of Tyre, where it yet remains to our days.”
Other instances he adduces by way of proof, and at length
he comes to the conclusion, that the production of these
geese from fruits is the erroneous opinion of the ignorant;
it being ascertained that “they are produced only by the
nature of the ocean sea, which is the cause and production
of many wonderful things.”</p>

<p>In this view he was supported by Turner and others:
“When,” says Turner, “at a certain time an old ship, or
a plank, or a pine-mast rots in the sea, something like a
little fungus at first makes its appearance, which at length
puts on the manifest form of birds; afterwards these are
clothed with feathers, and at last become living and flying
fowl.” (“Avium Præcip. Hist.,” <i>Art.</i> “<span class="small-caps">Anser.</span>”) Turner,
however, does not give up the goose-tree, but informs Gesner
that it is a different bird from the brent or bernicle goose,
which takes its origin from it. (Gesner, “De Avibus,” iii.
p. 107.) Passing a host of other authorities, with their
accumulated proofs, and the depositions of unimpeachable
witnesses, we may come to Gerard, who, in 1597, published
the following account in his “Herball, or Generall
Historie of <span class="no-wrap">Plantes”:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There is a small island in Lancashire, called the Pile
of Foulders, wherein are found the broken pieces of old
and bruised ships, some whereof have been cast thither by
shipwracke, and also the trunks or bodies, with the
branches, of old and rotten trees, cast up there likewise;
whereon is found a certaine spume, or froth, that in time
breedeth unto certaine shels, in shape like those of the
muskle, but sharper pointed, and of a whitish colour,
wherein is contained a thing in forme like a lace of silke,
finely woven as it were together, of a whitish colour; one
ende whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell, even
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_251" title="251"> </a><!--275.png-->
as the fish of oisters and muskles are; the other ende is
made fast unto the belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which
in time cometh to the shape and forme of a bird: when it
is perfectly formed the shell gapeth open, and the first
thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string; next
come the legs of the bird hanging out, and as it groweth
greater, it openeth the shell by degrees, till at length it is
all come forth, and hangeth only by the bill: in short
space after, it cometh to full maturitie, and falleth into
the sea, where it gathereth feathers, and groweth to a fowle
bigger than a mallard and lesser than a goose, having
blacke legs and bill or beake, and feathers blacke and
white, spotted in such manner as is our magge-pie, called
in some places a pie-annet, which the people of Lancashire
call by no other name than a tree-goose; which place
aforesaide, and all those parts adjoining, do so much
abound therewith, that one of the best is bought for
three-pence. For the truth hereof, if any doubt, may it
please them to repaire unto me, and I shall satisfie them
by the testimonie of good witnesses.”</p>

<p>Meyer, who wrote a treatise on this “bird without
father or mother,” states that he opened a hundred of the
goose-bearing shells, and in all of them found the rudiments
of the bird completely formed.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Murray, in an account of the barnacle
published in the “Philosophical Transactions,” says that
“these shells are hung at the tree by a neck, longer than
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_252" title="252"> </a><!--276.png-->
the shell, of a filmy substance, round and hollow, and
creased not unlike the windpipe of a chicken, spreading
out broadest where it is fastened to the tree, from which
it seems to draw and convey the matter which serves for
the growth and vegetation of the shell, and the little bird
within it.</p>

<p>“In every shell that I opened,” he continues, “I found
a perfect sea-fowl; the little bill like that of a goose; the
eyes marked; the head, neck, breast, wing, tail, and feet
formed; the feathers everywhere perfectly shaped, and
blackish coloured; and the feet like those of other water-fowl,
to my best remembrance.”</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed, however, that there were none
who doubted this marvellous story, or who took steps to
refute it. Belon, so long ago as 1551, and others after
him, treated it with ridicule, and a refutation may be found
in Willughby’s “Ornithology,” which was edited by Ray
in 1678. An excellent account of the Barnacle was published
by Mr. Thompson in the “Philosophical Transactions”
for 1835, while the latest and most complete treatise
on the subject is Mr. Darwin’s “Monograph of the Cirrhipedia,”
published by the Ray Society.</p>

<p>What, then, is the marine production from which the
Barnacle Goose was thought to be engendered? Merely
certain shell-covered cirrhipedous creatures, called Barnacles
(<i>Lepas anatifera</i>&mdash;Linn.), which are to be found
adhering in clusters to floating logs of wood, the timbers
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_253" title="253"> </a><!--277.png-->
of wrecked vessels, the sides of rocks, and other objects
which afford a secure attachment.</p>

<div class="img-center" id="pg253">

<div class="caption">BARNACLES. <i>From nature.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Each individual consists of a body enclosed in a shell,
not unlike that of a mussel in figure, and of a fleshy
worm-like stem or peduncle, the extremity of which is
fixed to the object upon which the animal is stationed.
This stem is tubular, tolerably firm, and has a fleshy feel;
it is composed exteriorly of a fine coriaceous outer membrane,
bedewed with a watery fluid, and beneath this, of
an inner membrane of considerable density, apparently
consisting of muscular fibres, running for the most part in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_254" title="254"> </a><!--278.png-->
parallel longitudinal lines. That these fibres are muscular
we may conclude from the animal having the power of
contracting the stem, or of twisting it in various directions.
Within the tube there is a fluid secretion.</p>

<p>The shell is composed of five pieces, four of which are
lateral, two on each side; while between the valves down the
back is interposed a single narrow slip uniting them together.
Their colour is white, more or less tinged with purplish blue.
Along the anterior margin the valves are but partially
connected by a membrane, leaving a large fissure, through
which emerge the plumose and jointed arms or cirrhi.</p>

<p>The food of the Barnacles consists of small crustacea and
mollusca. These are entangled by the many-jointed plumose
cirrhi, which are perpetually thrown out and folded
again, so as to serve the purpose of a casting-net, and drag
the prey to the mouth, where it is seized and crushed.</p>

<p>With regard to the reproduction of these creatures, the
eggs are seen enclosed at certain times within the hollow
of the peduncle, where they appear of a blue colour, and
render the pedicle opaque; from this they pass through a
minute conduit into the cavity of the mantle, where they
are arranged like two leaflets, attached to the septum
between the body and the peduncle. They are enclosed
in a film, out of which they fall when ready to hatch.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, as we learn from Mr.
Thompson<a id="Marker_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="marker">147</a>, that the young barnacles and other cirrhipeda
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_255" title="255"> </a><!--279.png-->
on emerging from the egg are quite free, and very
different from their parents. “They possess locomotive
organs, consisting of a large anterior pair of limbs,
provided with a sucker, and hooks for the purpose of
mooring themselves at pleasure to various objects&mdash;and
also of six pairs of swimming-limbs, acting in concert like
oars. Besides these, they have a tail bent under the body,
consisting of two joints and terminating in four bristles:
this is an additional locomotive organ. Thus endowed,
they swim along in a series of bounds, the oars and tail
giving in measured time successive impulses. They have,
moreover, large lateral eyes set on peduncles, and the body
is covered with a sort of shell, as in certain crustacea (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Cyclops</i>), which they closely resemble,” and for which Mr.
Thompson at first mistook them.</p>

<p>In due time a metamorphosis takes place; the shell is
thrown off, the eyes disappear, the limbs become transformed
to cirrhi, the regular valves develop themselves,
the peduncle shoots forth, and the animal becomes permanently
fixed.</p>

<p>Believing these little creatures to be the larvæ of some
crustaceous animal, some of them, says Mr. Thompson,
were collected in the spring, and in order to see what
changes they might undergo, were kept in a glass
vessel, covered by such a depth of sea-water, that they
could be examined at any time by means of a common
magnifying-glass. They were taken May 1st, and on the
night of the 8th the author had the satisfaction to find
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_256" title="256"> </a><!--280.png-->
that two of them had thrown off their exuviæ, and,
wonderful to say, were firmly adhering to the bottom of
the vessel, and changed to young barnacles. In this stage
the sutures between the valves of the shell and of the
operculum were visible, and the movements of the arms
of the animal within, although these last were not completely
developed: the eyes also were still perceptible,
although the principal part of the colouring-matter appeared
to have been thrown off with the exuviæ. On the
10th another individual was seen in the act of throwing
off its shell, and attaching itself as the others to the bottom
of the glass. It only remains to add, that as the
secretion of the calcareous matter goes on in the compartments
destined for the valves of the shelly covering, the
eyes gradually disappear, from the increasing opacity
thence produced, and the visual ray is extinguished for
the remainder of the animal’s life; the arms at the same
time acquire their usual ciliated appearance. Thus, then,
an animal originally natatory and locomotive, and provided
with a distinct organ of sight, becomes permanently and
immovably fixed, and its optic apparatus obliterated; and
furnishes not only a new and important physiological fact,
but is the only instance in nature of so extraordinary a
metamorphosis.</p>

<p>We have been thus led to dilate upon barnacles in connection
with Shakespeare’s allusion to them, at somewhat
greater length than we should otherwise have done, on
account of the interest which attaches to the old story,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_257" title="257"> </a><!--281.png-->
handed down through so many centuries, and because
we have looked into many books in vain for a plain
account of its origin, and a modern description of the
cirrhiped devoid of scientific technicalities.</p>

<p>With this apology, then, to the reader, we return to the
birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD-FOWL.</div>

<p>The following dialogue between Malvolio and the
Clown, in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, concerning wild-fowl, has reference
to the theory of Pythagoras on the subject of the
transmigration of souls, and is quite as applicable to birds
in general as to wild-fowl in <span class="no-wrap">particular:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<i class="speaker">Clo.</i> What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning
wild-fowl?</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Mal.</i> That the soul of our grandam might haply
inhabit a bird.</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Clo.</i> What thinkest thou of his opinion?</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Mal.</i> I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve
his opinion.</p>

<p><i class="speaker">Clo.</i> Fare thee well: remain thou still in darkness: thou
shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow
of thy wits; and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess
the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.”&mdash;<i>Twelfth
Night</i>, Act iv. Sc. 2.<a id="Marker_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="marker">148</a></p>
</blockquote>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258" title="258"> </a><!--282.png-->

<p>Amongst the wild-fowl may be classed the various
species of divers and grebes which frequent our shores
and harbours, especially in winter, and which afford good
sport to the gunner, by their wonderful power of diving
long distances in their efforts to escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LOON.</div>

<p>The provincial name of “loon” (<i>Macbeth</i>, Act v. Sc. 3)
is applied both to a diver and to a grebe. On many parts
of the coast the red-throated diver (<i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>)
is known as the “loon,” “speckled loon,” and
“sprat loon.” In Norfolk, the name is applied to the
great-crested grebe (<i>Podiceps cristatus</i>).</p>

<p>Shakespeare employs the term “loon” as synonymous
with “coward;” and if we call to mind the habits of the
two birds to which the same name has been applied, it is
certainly not ill bestowed upon one who lacks courage to
face an enemy.</p>

<p>Another species of grebe is referred to by Shakespeare
in his <span class="no-wrap"><i>Venus and Adonis:</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Like a <i>dive-dapper</i> peering through a wave,</div>
<div class="line">Who, being look’d on, ducks as quickly in.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the little grebe, or dabchick (<i>Podiceps minor</i>).
In some parts of the country we have heard it called
“di’ dapper,” but it was not until we had met with the
passage above quoted that the meaning of the word
became apparent.</p>

<p>On the subject of “loons,” the Rev. H. Jones has some
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_259" title="259"> </a><!--283.png-->
appropriate remarks in a volume of essays entitled “Holiday
Papers” (p. 65). “The great-crested grebe, or loon,”
he says, “is a giant compared to our little friend the dabchick,
and altogether makes a more respectable appearance,
both in picture and pond. The habits and figure
of the two birds, though, are much the same. There are
numbers of loons on the ‘broads’ of Norfolk. Indeed it
is in East Anglia that I have most especially watched the
dabchick. These loons, like the lesser grebes, incubate
and leave their eggs in the wet, and meet with the
same ridiculous failure when they attempt to walk.
Like them, they are capital divers, and begin from the
egg.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CORMORANT.</div>

<p>Close to the divers in the natural system of birds come
the cormorants, whose powers of swimming are in no way
inferior to those of the species we have just named.
They swim so low in the water that nothing but the
head, neck, and top of the back appear above the surface.
The tail, composed of stiff elastic feathers, is submerged
and used as a rudder, and the wings as oars. The address
with which they dive, and the rapidity of their movements,
are wonderful; no less so than the pertinacity with which
they pursue their prey. Voracious in the <span class="no-wrap">extreme,&mdash;</span></p>

occasionally for breath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FISHING WITH CORMORANTS.</div>

<p>Indeed the voracity of this bird, which, doubtless,
suggested the name <i>cormoranus</i>, has become so proverbial,
that a man of large appetite is often likened to a cormorant.</p>

<p>In this sense Shakespeare has frequently employed the
word as an adjective, and we find such expressions <span class="no-wrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S CORMORANTS.</div>

<p>Ravenous as the cormorant is, it is easily tamed, and
becomes very attached and familiar. The use of trained
cormorants for fishing is very ancient, and is believed to
have originated with the Chinese.<a id="Marker_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="marker">149</a> The practice has
been known in England, however, for many centuries.
Ogleby, who went on an embassy to China in the time
of James I., and who published an account of his travels
on his return, describes the way in which the Chinese take
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_261" title="261"> </a><!--285.png-->
fish with cormorants. James himself, who was a great
sportsman, kept trained cormorants for many years, and
was accustomed to travel about the country with them,
fishing as he went.</p>

<p>We have seen a curious MS. diary<a id="Marker_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="marker">150</a> in the British
Museum, written in old French, by Hans Jacob Wurmser
v. Vendenheym, who accompanied Lewis Frederick, Duke
of Wurtemberg, in his diplomatic mission to England in
1610, from which it appears that the Duke, proceeding by
Ware, Royston, Cambridge, and Newmarket, arrived at
Thetford on the 7th of May,<a id="Marker_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="marker">151</a> where King James the First
was then amusing himself with hunting, hawking, and
fishing with cormorants.</p>

<p>The entry with reference to the cormorants is as
<span class="no-wrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The King had a regular establishment for his cormorants
on the river at Westminster, and created a new office,
“Master of the Royal Cormorants,” which office was first
held by John Wood, as appears from various documents
in the Record Office. Amongst other entries, for a knowledge
of which I am indebted to Mr. F.&nbsp;H. Salvin, the
distinguished falconer, are the <span class="no-wrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“No. 1, James I., 1611, April 11.&mdash;To John Wood, the
sum of £30, in respect he hath been at extraordinary
charge in bringing up and training of certain fowls called
cormorants, and making of them fit for the use of fishing,
to be taken to him of His Majesty’s free gift and reward.
By writ, dated the 5th day of April, 1611.</p>

<p>“No. 2, May 27th, 1612.&mdash;Payment to the said John
Wood for getting cormorants from the north.</p>

<p>“No. 3, August 31st, 1618.&mdash;James I. to Robert Wood.
Advance of £66 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, in part payment of the sum of
£286 due in respect of the cormorant houses, and making
nine ponds, &amp;c., at Westminster, the ground called the
Vine-garden having been taken upon lease of the Lord
Danvers.</p>

<p>[“In this document,” says Mr. Salvin, “this Wood is
described as keeper of His Majesty’s cormorants, ospreys,
and otters. It is therefore clear that the fishing-hawk was
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_263" title="263"> </a><!--287.png-->
tried, and as we hear so little about it afterwards, there
can be no doubt but that it proved a failure, which,
indeed, might have been expected, as the bird is what
falconers would call an habitual ‘carrier.’ Neither do
the otters seem to have answered. Vines were grown in
Surrey for wine in ancient times, and I wonder if this
vine-garden was for that purpose.”]</p>

<p>“No. 4, February 28th, 1619.&mdash;To John Wood, whom
His Majesty heretofore appointed to attend the French
ambassadors, with the cormorants sent by His Majesty’s
good brother, the French King, the sum of £215, for so
much by him disbursed and laid out for his charges
incident to the performance of the said service, over and
above the sum of £50, impressed unto him, for and
towards the said charges, appearing by his bill, of the
particulars thereof, delivered in upon oath, and allowed
by us and the rest of the Commissioners of the Treasury.
By writ dated the 18th July, 1609, and by confirmation
dated the last of July, 1618.</p>

<p>“14th October, 1619.&mdash;To Robert Wood, whom His
Majesty intendeth to send, with divers cormorants, to
his good cousin, the Duke of Lorraine, the sum of £60,
by way of an imprest towards defraying the expenses in
that journey. By writ, dated 7th October, 1619.</p>

<p>“28th August, 1624.&mdash;To Robert Wood, the sum of
£98 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, in full satisfaction of the charge and loss
sustained by Luke Wood, in his late travels, with three
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_264" title="264"> </a><!--288.png-->
cormorants, to Venice, having been stayed in his passage
thither, and his cormorants taken away from him by the
Duke of Savoy.”</p>

<p>[“From these two documents,” says Mr. Salvin, “it
would appear that cormorant fishing was likely to have
become fashionable upon the continent, if poor Wood and
his birds had not come to grief.</p>

<p>“The civil wars in the next reign extinguished the
office of The Master of the Royal Cormorants, and his
assistants, and in the Record Office we find this petition
from poor old Mr. Wood, who appears to have been
rather hard-up and neglected in his old age.</p>

<p>“‘A prayer of Richard Wood, of Walton-on-Thames,
Surrey, to Charles II., for restoration to his place as cormorant
keeper, which he held, he says, from King James’s
first coming to England, to the late wars, in which he
served as a soldier, but being now ninety-five years old,
has been forced to retire to a dwelling at Walton.’”<a id="Marker_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="marker">152</a>]</p>

<p>“A document in the State Paper Office, sealed with the
royal signet, and addressed to the ‘Treasurer of the
Chamber’ for the time being, authorizes him to pay unto
John Harris, gentleman, His Majesty’s cormorant keeper,
for his repairing yearly unto the north parts of England
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_265" title="265"> </a><!--289.png-->
to take haggard cormorants for His Majesty’s disport in
fishing, the yearly allowance of eighty-four pounds, to be
paid on the four usual feasts of the year, during His
Majesty’s pleasure, in such manner as John Wood and
Robert Wood, or George Hutchinson, gentlemen, formerly
received.”<a id="Marker_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="marker">153</a></p>

<p>Although Shakespeare has mentioned the cormorant in
many of his Plays, he has nowhere alluded to the sport
with trained birds; and this is somewhat singular, inasmuch
as he has made frequent mention of the then popular
pastime of hawking, and he did not die until some
years after James I. had made fishing with cormorants
a fashionable amusement.<a id="Marker_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="marker">154</a> The sport has long since
ceased to amuse royalty, and by English sportsmen is
now almost abandoned.<a id="Marker_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="marker">155</a></p>

<p>In no passage, however, do we find a reference to any

therefore, were the names by which, in Shakespeare’s
day, these sharpers were known.</p>

<p>“The <i>gull-groper</i> was generally an old gambling miser,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_268" title="268"> </a><!--292.png-->
who frequented the ordinary to save the charge of housekeeping,
under the pretext of meeting with travellers and
seeking company, and carried in his pouch some hundred
or two hundred pounds in twenty-shilling pieces. By
long experience he knew to an ace how much the losing
player was worth, and as he scratched his head and paced
uneasily up and down the room, as if he wanted the
ostler, he takes him to a side window and tells him that
he was, forsooth, sorry to see so honest a gentleman in
bad luck, but that ‘dice were made of women’s bones and
would cozen the wisest,’ and that for his father’s sake, Sir
Luke Littlebrain (he had learned the name from the
drawer), if it pleased him he need not leave off play for
a hundred pound or two. The youth, eager to redeem
his losses, accepted the money ordinarily with grateful
thanks. The gold was poured upon the table, and a hard
bond was hastily drawn up for the repayment at the next
quarter-day, deducting so much for the scrivener’s expense
at changing the pieces. If he lost, the usurer hugged his
bond, and laughed in his sleeve. If Sir Andrew won, the
gull-groper would then steal silently out of the noisy
room to avoid repayment. The day that the bond
became due, Hunks was sure not to be within, and if
seen, in some way contrived to make the debtor break
the bond, and then transformed himself into two sergeants,
who clapped the youth in prison. From thence he usually
escaped shorn of a goodly manor or fair lordship, worth

<span class="smaller">VARIOUS BIRDS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FOREGOING
CHAPTERS.</span></h2>


<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the comprehensive titles of the
preceding chapters, there are several birds mentioned by
Shakespeare which cannot, with propriety, be included in
any of them. We have, therefore, deemed it advisable to
notice them separately under the above heading.</p>

<p>Naturalists have frequently remarked upon the propensity
which some birds have to become restless and noisy
before rain. Familiar examples are, the Peacock; the
Green Woodpecker, which, on this account, in some parts
of the country, is called “rain-bird;” the Golden Plover,
whose Latin and French name, <i>Pluvialis</i> and <i>Pluvier</i>,
have reference to the same peculiarity; and the Woodcock,
which, as Gilbert White says, has been observed “to be
remarkably listless against snowy, foul weather.” Shakespeare
has noticed this peculiarity in the <span class="no-wrap">Parrot:&mdash;</span></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_272" title="272"> </a><!--296.png-->

<blockquote>
<p>“More clamorous than a parrot against rain.”&mdash;<i>As You
Like It</i>, Act iv. Sc. 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">THE PARROT.</div>

<p>It is not quite clear when parrots were first introduced
as cage birds, but their attractive colours, and aptitude for
learning tricks and words, no doubt brought them into
notice at an early period. Shakespeare knew that to ensure
success in teaching a parrot, the bird must be
<span class="no-wrap">rewarded:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to calculate or limit the speed which can
be produced by the effort of a wing’s vibration. We may,
nevertheless, ascertain with tolerable accuracy the rate of
a bird’s flight, as follows:&mdash;If we note the number of
seconds which are occupied by a bird in passing between
two fixed points in its line of flight, and measure the
distance between these points, we resolve the question to
a simple “rule-of-three” sum; inasmuch as, knowing the
number of yards flown in a certain number of seconds, we
can ascertain the distance traversed in 3,600 seconds, or an
hour, and thus obtain the rate of speed per hour; supposing,
of course, the speed to be uniform. In this way

<div class="sidenote">THE SWALLOW’S HERB.</div>

<p>Old authors tell us that when the young swallows are
hatched, they are blind for some time, and that the parent
birds bring to the nest a plant called <i>Chelidonium</i>, or
Swallow’s herb, which has the property of restoring sight.
This popular fallacy appears to be widely disseminated.
The plant is the well-known Celandine (<i>Chelidonium majus</i>).
It belongs to the <i>Papaveraceæ</i>, or poppies, and may be
found growing in waste places to the height of two feet
or more. It is brittle, slightly hairy, and full of a yellow,
fœtid juice, and bears small yellow flowers in long-stalked
umbels.</p>

<p>The name <i>Chelidonium</i> is derived no doubt from the
Greek χελιδων, a swallow: but the reason for its being thus
named is not so obvious. Some authors assert that it was
so called on account of its flowering about the time of the
arrival of the swallow, while others maintain that it derived
its appellation from being the plant medicinally made use
of by that bird.</p>

<p>The belief that animals and birds possess a knowledge
of certain plants which will cure a disease, or benefit them
in some way, is very ancient, and this particular plant is
alluded to by old authors as being especially selected for
the purpose. Pliny observes (Hist. Nat. fol. 1530, p. 461,
xv.): “Animalia quoque invenire herbas, <i>inprimisque
chelidoniam</i>. Hac enim hirundines oculis pullorum in nido
restituunt visum, ut quidam volunt, etiam erutis oculis.” (!)
And the same author further remarks: “Chelidoniam visui
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_280" title="280"> </a><!--304.png-->
saluberrimam hirundines monstravere vexatis pullorum
oculis ilia medentes.”</p>

<p>Gerard, referring to this plant, in his “Herball, or Generall
Historie of Plantes” (1597), observes:&mdash;“It is called celandine,
not because it then first springeth at the comming in of
the swallowes, or dieth when they goe away; for as we haue
saide, it may be founde all the yeere; but because some hold
opinion that with this herbe the dams restore sight to their
yoong ones when their eies be out, the which things are
vaine and false: for Cornelius Celsus in his sixt booke
doth witnesse that when the sight of the eies of diuers
yoong birdes be put foorth by some outward meanes, it
will after a time be restored of itselfe, and soonest of all
the sight of the swallow, whereupon, (as the same saith)
that the tale or fable grew, how, thorow an herbe the dams
restore that thing, which healeth of itselfe: the very same
doth Aristotle alleadge in the sixt booke of the historie of
liuing creatures: the eies of young swallowes, saith he,
that are not fledge, if a man do pricke them out, do grow
againe, and afterwards do perfectly recouer their sight.”
Subsequently, when speaking of the “virtues” of the plant,
the sage Gerard continues:&mdash;“The iuice of the herbe is
good to sharpen the sight, for it clenseth and consumeth
awaie slimie things that cleaue about the ball of the eie,
and hinder the sight.” The root was considered good for
yellow-jaundice, and also (being chewed) for toothache.
Gerard adds, “The roote cut in small peeces is good to be
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_281" title="281"> </a><!--305.png-->
giuen vnto hawkes against sundrie diseases;” and Turbervile,
in his “Booke of Falconrie” (1611), treats of a cure for
“a blow giuen to the eye, or of some other mischance,” as
follows:&mdash;“Sometimes the eyes of hawkes are hurt by
some mishappe, some stripe, or otherwise, as I said afore.
Against such unlooked-for mischances, Master Malopin, in
his boke of the Prince, willeth to take the juice of <i>Celondine</i>,
otherwise <i>Arondell</i>, or <i>Swallowes hearbe</i>, and to
convey it into the eye. And if it bee not to be had
greene, to take it drie, and to beat it into powder, and
to blow it into her eye with a quill, and this shall recure
the hawke.”</p>

<p>A marginal note to this paragraph informs us that
“Arondell” in French is “Hirundo,” a swallow, otherwise
called “Chelidon.”</p>

<p>Parkinson, in his “Theatrum Botanicum” (1640), alludes
to two species of Celandine, <i>C. major</i> and <i>minor</i>, and
says:&mdash;“Some call them <i>Chelidonia major</i> and <i>minor</i>, and
tooke the name, as Dioscorides saith, because it springeth
when swallowes come in; and withered at their going away
(which is true in neither, the greater, whereof Dioscorides
chiefely speaketh, being greene both winter and sommer;
and the lesser springeth before swallowes come in, and is
gone and withered long before their departure). Dioscorides
likewise, and Pliny also, say it tooke that name from
swallowes that cured their young ones’ eyes, that were hurt,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_282" title="282"> </a><!--306.png-->
with bringing this herbe and putting it to them: but Aristotle,
and Celsus from him, doe shew that the young ones
of partridges, doves, swallowes, &amp;c., will recover their sight
(being hurt) of themselves in time, without anything applyed
unto them, and therefore Celsus accounteth this
saying but a fable.”</p>

<p>It is curious to observe how universally this plant appears
to be associated with the swallow. <i>Chelidonium majus</i>
is <i>Calidonia maggiore</i> of the Italians; <i>Yerva de las
gelondrinhas</i> of the Spaniards; <i>Chelidoine Felongue</i> and
<i>Esclaire</i> of the French; and <i>Schwalbenkraut</i> of the
Germans; while we, in English, call it <i>Celandine</i>,
<i>Swallow’s-herb</i>, and <i>Swallow-wort</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the Swallow-herb there is the Swallow-stone, to
which wonderful properties have been likewise attributed
in connection with diseases of the eye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SWALLOW’S STONE.</div>

<p>Dr. Lebour, in a communication to <i>The Zoologist</i>, for
1866, says (p. 523):&mdash;“I met last summer, in Brittany, with
a curious fact relating to the habits of the common house-swallow.
In Brittany there exists a wide-spread belief
among the peasantry that certain stones found in swallows’
nests are sovereign cures for certain diseases of the eye.
I think the same notion holds in many other parts of
France, and also in some of our English counties. These
stones are held in high estimation, and the happy possessor
usually lets them on hire at a sous or so a day. Now, I
had the good fortune to see some of these ‘swallow-stones,’
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_283" title="283"> </a><!--307.png-->
and to examine them. I found them to be the
hard polished calcareous opercula of some species of
<i>Turbo</i>, and although their worn state precludes the idea
of identifying the species, yet I am confident that they belong
to no European <i>Turbo</i>. The largest I have seen was
three-eighths of an inch long, and one-fourth of an inch
broad; one side is flat, or nearly so, and the other is
convex, more or less so in different specimens. Their
peculiar shape enables one to push them under the eyelid
across the eyeball, and thus they remove any eyelash
or other foreign substance which may have got in
one’s eye;<a id="Marker_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="marker">163</a> further than this, they have no curing power:
the peasants, however, believe they are omnipotent. The
presence of these opercula in swallows’ nests is very
curious,<a id="Marker_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="marker">164</a> and leads one to suppose that they must have
been brought there from some distant shore in the
swallow’s stomach. If so, they must have inhabited the
poor bird for a considerable time, and proved a great
nuisance to it.”</p>

<p>The tradition on this subject, current amongst the
peasants in Brittany, is no doubt of some antiquity,<a id="Marker_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="marker">165</a> since
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_284" title="284"> </a><!--308.png-->
the allusion which Longfellow has made to it in his poem
of “Evangeline” would seem to confirm this impression,
inasmuch as we may assume that the tradition found its
way into Acadia through the French colonists who were
the first to settle there.</p>

<p>Longfellow, in his “Evangeline,” <span class="no-wrap">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests in the rafters,</div>
<div class="line">Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow</div>
<div class="line">Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;</div>
<div class="line">Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The connection between the stone and the herb is,
that both were said to be brought to the nest by the
swallow, and both were deemed remedies for defective
sight. There is this difference, however, between the current
opinion in Brittany and the popular notion in Acadia,
that in the former case it is the finder of the stone who
is thereby benefited, in the latter it is the sight of the
fledglings which is thereby restored.</p>

<p>A friend has suggested that the tradition may have
originated with the Chinese, to whom the edible swallows’
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_285" title="285"> </a><!--309.png-->
nests have been so long known, and to whom credit is
now given for having been acquainted centuries ago with
inventions which until recently were believed to be
modern. Not being conversant, however, with Chinese,
we are unable to say whether there is in that language
any equivalent for “swallow-stone,” or “swallow’s-herb,”
or whether ancient Chinese authors in any way throw light
upon the subject.<a id="Marker_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="marker">166</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OSTRICH.</div>

<p>Pliny’s mention of the stone found in the stomach of
the swallow brings to mind the stones found in the
stomach of the ostrich, and so leads to the consideration
of another bird noticed by Shakespeare. The food of
the ostrich is said to consist of the tops of shrubby
plants, seeds, and grain; strange to say, however, it will
swallow, with indiscriminating voracity, stones, sticks,
pieces of metal, cord, leather, and other substances, which
often occasion its destruction. The extraordinary digestion
of the bird is thus alluded to in the threat of the
rebel Cade, when confronted by Alexander <span class="no-wrap">Iden:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the fable alluded to is a
classical one. But this is not the case. Many and
various explanations have been offered as regards its
origin, but none is more ingenious, and at the same time
more plausible, than the explanation suggested by Mr.
Bartlett, the energetic Superintendent of the Zoological
Society’s Gardens. In a letter addressed to the editor of
<i>Land and Water</i>, dated the 3rd April, 1869, Mr. Bartlett
<span class="no-wrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Having devoted much attention to investigations upon
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_288" title="288"> </a><!--312.png-->
the subject of the supply of food provided by several
species of birds for their young, I have collected many
interesting facts showing that in some instances the
parents prepare by partial digestion, and in others by
the addition of a secreted nutritive substance, the food
intended for the support of their offspring. The one
which I am about to relate I was certainly not prepared
to expect; nevertheless, such facts as I now lay before
you have caused me no little astonishment, as they appear
to me to afford a solution to the well-known and ancient
story of the Pelican in the Wilderness. I have heard that
the so-called fable originated, or is to be found, on some
of the early Egyptian monuments (I do not know where),
but that the representations are more like flamingoes than
pelicans. I have published elsewhere, in the ‘Proceedings
of the Zoological Society,’ for March 1869, what I consider
to be the facts of the case, and take this opportunity of
referring to the matter. The flamingoes here in the gardens
have frequently shown signs of breeding, and have been
supplied with heaps of sand to form their nests, but
without result; nevertheless they appear to take considerable
notice of a pair of Cariamas in the same aviary.
These birds have a habit of bending back their heads,
and with open gaping mouths utter loud and somewhat
distressing sounds. This habit at once attracts the
flamingoes, and very frequently one or more of them
advance towards the cariamas, and standing erect over
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_289" title="289"> </a><!--313.png-->
the bird, by a slight up-and-down movement of the head,
raise up into its mouth a considerable quantity of red
coloured fluid. As soon as the upper part of the throat
and mouth becomes filled, it will drop or run down from
the corners of the flamingo’s mouth; the flamingo then
bends its long neck over the gaping cariama and pours
this fluid into the mouth, and as frequently on the back
of the cariama. Having seen this repeatedly, I took an
opportunity of obtaining a portion of this fluid and
submitted it to the examination of Dr. Murie. We
placed it under the microscope, and find it composed of
little else than blood; in fact, the red blood-corpuscles are
wonderfully abundant in the otherwise clear and almost
transparent glutinous fluid. That this does not proceed
from any disease or injury done to the flamingo, nor arise
or is produced by any portion or part of the food taken
by them, I am perfectly certain, for the birds are in the
most vigorous health and condition; but I believe that it
is an attempt to supply food to the cariamas, just as the
hedge-sparrow and other birds supply food to the young
cuckoo, and I have no doubt, if a careful observer had the
opportunity of watching the flamingoes on their breeding-ground,
he would find that this is the mode of feeding
their young: no doubt other food is also provided, but
most likely mixed with this secretion. I think it highly
probable that this habit was noticed in ancient Egypt,
and, by the confusion of names in translation, the pelican
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_290" title="290"> </a><!--314.png-->
was supposed to be the bird intended; in fact, I have
heard that the representation (which I am very anxious
to see) is much more like a flamingo than a pelican.
Again, a flamingo is much more a bird of the wilderness
than the pelican, seeing that the pelican requires a
good supply of fish, while the flamingo can live
and does well upon very small insects, seeds, and little
fry, and is found in places in which the pelican would
starve.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This communication naturally drew forth some comments.
Mr. Houghton, in a long letter to the editor of
the same journal, dated 24th April, 1869, says:&mdash;“That
this is the origin of the old story of the pelican feeding
its young with its blood seems very plausible. I purpose
to examine this ingenious idea, and to offer a few remarks
on the old fable. It is commonly supposed&mdash;and you
will often find it so expressed in works on natural history&mdash;that
this fable is a classical one. This is an error: I
have searched in vain amongst classical authors for any
allusion to the pelican feeding its young with its blood.
To the Greeks this bird was known by the name of πελεκάν,
or πελέκας, or πελεκινος, though it would appear that some
species of woodpecker was also intended by the word
πελέκας (see Aristoph. <i>Aves</i>, 1155). Aristotle mentions
pelicans two or three times in his ‘History of Animals;’
he speaks of their migratory habits and flying in crowds.
He says they take large shell-fish into their pouches (ἐν
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_291" title="291"> </a><!--315.png-->
τῷ πρὸ τῆς κοιλίας τόπῳ), wherein the molluscs are
softened. They then throw them up and pick out the
flesh from the opened valves. Ælian merely repeats this
story, only he says the shell-fish are received into the
stomach. In another place he says there is mutual
hostility between the pelican and the quail. The pelican
was known to the Romans under the name of <i>onocrotalus</i>.
Pliny says this bird is like the swan, except that under
the throat there is a sort of second crop of astonishing
capacity. There is, of course, no doubt that the pelican
is here intended. Cicero says there is a bird called
<i>platalea</i> which pursues other birds and causes them to
drop the fish they have caught, which it devours itself.
He then gives the same story as Ælian, viz., that this bird
softens shell-fish in its stomach, &amp;c. The first part of
this account is true of the parasitic gulls (<i>Lestris</i>). It is
uncertain what bird Cicero alludes to by the name
<i>platalea</i>. Pliny gives the same story as Cicero, and calls
the bird <i>platea</i>. The fable, then, is no classical one.
Whence did it originate? Does any pictorial representation
occur on the Egyptian monuments, as Mr. Bartlett
has been informed? I am inclined to think&mdash;but I speak
under correction&mdash;that such a representation does not
occur. Horapollo (i. 54) tells us that when the ancient
Egyptians want to represent a fool they depict the
pelican, because this bird, instead of laying its eggs on
lofty and secure places, merely scratches up the ground
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_292" title="292"> </a><!--316.png-->
and there lays. The people surround the place with dried
cow’s dung, and set fire to it. The pelican sees the smoke,
and endeavours to extinguish the fire with her wings, the
motion of which only fans the flame. Thus she burns
her wings, and falls an easy prey to the fowlers. Some
Egyptian priests, considering this behaviour evinces great
love of its young, do not eat the bird; others, again,
thinking it is a mark of folly, eat it. The Egyptians,
however, did believe in a bird feeding its young with its
blood, and this bird is none other than a vulture. Horapollo
says (i. 11) that a vulture symbolises a compassionate
person (ἐλεήμονα), because during the 120 days of its
nurture of its offspring, if food cannot be had, ‘it opens
its own thigh and permits the young to partake of the
blood, so that they may not perish from want.’ This is
alluded to in the following lines by Georgius <span class="no-wrap">Pisidas:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">Τὸν μηρὸν ἐκτέμοντες, ἡματωμένοις<br />
Γάλακτος ὀλκοῖς ζωπυροῦσι τὰ βρέφη.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst classical authors, the love of the vulture for its
young was proverbial. But when do we first hear of the
fable of the pelican feeding its young with its blood? In
Patristic annotations on the Scriptures. I believe this is
the answer. The ecclesiastical fathers transferred the
Egyptian story from the vulture to the pelican, but
magnified the already sufficiently marvellous fable a
hundredfold, for the blood of the parent was not only
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_293" title="293"> </a><!--317.png-->
supposed to serve as food for the young, but was also
able to reanimate the dead offspring! Augustine, commenting
on Psalm cii. 5&mdash;‘I am like a pelican in the
wilderness’&mdash;says: ‘These birds [male pelicans] are said
to kill their young offspring by blows of their beaks, and
then to bewail their death for the space of three days.
At length, however, it is said the mother bird inflicts a
severe wound on herself, pouring the flowing blood over
the dead young ones, which instantly brings them to life.’
To the same effect write Eustathius, Isidorus, Epiphanius,
and a host of other writers, except that sometimes it was
the female who killed the young ones, while the male
reanimated them with its blood. This fable was supposed
to be a symbol of Christ’s love to men. I think, then, that
the very interesting fact of the flamingo feeding the
cariama with the red fluid and other contents of its
stomach can hardly be, as Mr. Bartlett conjectures, the
origin of the old fable of the pelican feeding its young
with its blood, because the Egyptian story of the vulture
wounding its thigh has nothing analogous to the natural-history
fact of the flamingo, while the fable of the pelican
pouring from its self-inflicted wound the life-restoring
blood which reanimates its offspring is still further from
the mark.”</p>

<p>In a short criticism upon the subject in the same
number of <i>Land and Water</i>, Mr. H.&nbsp;J. Hancock is
inclined to believe that some confusion has arisen in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_294" title="294"> </a><!--318.png-->
translation from the original Hebrew. “The word קָאַת
(<i>Kàh-ath'</i>), which is rendered πελεκάν in the Septuagint,
and Pelican, or Onocrotalus, in the Vulgate, is derived
from the verb קָא ‘to vomit,’ and signifies ‘a vomiter.’
This name, evidently a general one, may have been
intended by the Hebrew writers to apply either to such
birds as, like the pelican and many others, possess the
power of disgorging their food on being disturbed or
alarmed, or to such birds as are accustomed to nourish
their young from their own crops; and, in the latter case,
the curious bloody secretion of the flamingo may well
have given rise to the superstition concerning the pelican.
I may observe, as an evidence that the translators did not
consider the Hebrew word to be other than a general
name, that <i>Kà-ath'</i> is sometimes rendered ‘cormorant’
(Isa. xxxiv. 11; Zeph. ii. 14). For further information
concerning this point, I would refer your readers to the
‘Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance,’ p. 1083; Bate’s
‘Hebrew Dictionary,’ p. 538; and Parkhurst’s ‘Hebrew
Dictionary,’ pp. 631, 632.”</p>

<p>Shakespeare, doubtless, had not investigated the
subject so narrowly, but was content to accept the
common story as he found it, and to apply it metaphorically
as occasion required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE ENGLISH FENS.</div>

<p>The majority of the birds mentioned in this chapter are
not natives of the British Islands, but, strange as it may
appear, there is evidence to show that the pelican, or, to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_295" title="295"> </a><!--319.png-->
speak more correctly, a species of pelican, once inhabited
the English fens.</p>

<p>The peat-bogs of Cambridgeshire have yielded of late
years a large number of bones of birds, and amongst
these has been discovered the wing-bone of a pelican.
This interesting discovery was made known by M. Alphonse
Milne-Edwards, in an able article in the “Annales
des Sciences Naturelles,”<a id="Marker_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="marker">169</a> a translation of which subsequently
appeared in <i>The Ibis</i>.<a id="Marker_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="marker">170</a> The author thus anticipates
the objections of the <span class="no-wrap">sceptical:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We may be inclined, perhaps, to wonder that a single
bone, belonging (as it does) to a young animal, and consequently
not presenting all its anatomical characters,
should permit the exact recognition of the genus and
species of bird to which it belongs. So precise a determination
would not be always possible, but in the present
case there need be no doubt; for I have shown, in another
work,<a id="Marker_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="marker">171</a> that the wing-bone in the genus <i>Pelicanus</i> offers
extremely clear distinctive peculiarities, which do not
allow of its being confounded with that of any other
bird.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">THE PELICAN IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>The only species of pelican which has been recorded to
have occurred in England in recent times, is the great
white pelican, <i>P. onocrotalus</i>.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_296" title="296"> </a><!--320.png-->

<p>Latham has stated,<a id="Marker_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="marker">172</a> on the authority of Sir Thomas
Brown, that a pelican of this species was killed in Horsey
Fen in 1663. This statement was copied by Montagu,<a id="Marker_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="marker">173</a>
and subsequently by Dr. Fleming,<a id="Marker_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="marker">174</a> but there is no evidence
to show that the bird was a wild one. On the
contrary, it is probable, as suggested by Sir Thomas
Brown, that it may have been one of the King’s pelicans
which was lost about that time from St. James’s Park.</p>

<p>He says<a id="Marker_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="marker">175</a>:&mdash;“An <i>onocrotalus</i>, or pelican, shot upon
Horsey Fen, May 22, 1663, which, stuffed and cleaned, I
yet retain. It was three yards and a half between the
extremities of the wings; the chowle and beak answering
the usual description; the extremities of the wings for a
span deep brown; the rest of the body white; a fowl
which none could remember upon this coast.</p>

<p>“About the same time, I heard one of the king’s
pelicans was lost at St. James’s; perhaps this might be
the same.”</p>

<p>Latham was further assured by Dr. Leith, that in the
month of May he saw a brown pelican fly over his head
on Blackheath, in Kent. Montagu, however, suggests
that the bird was an immature swan.</p>

<p>In <i>The Zoologist</i> for 1856 (p. 5321), the Rev. H.&nbsp;B.
Tristram has recorded, that on the 25th of August, 1856,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_297" title="297"> </a><!--321.png-->
the remains of a pelican were picked up on the shore at
Castle Eden, Durham. Such are the scanty records of
the appearance of a pelican in England in modern
times.</p>

<p>The bone found in Cambridgeshire may have belonged
to <i>P. onocrotalus</i>, a native of South and South-Eastern
Europe, and which is stated to be “common on the lakes
and watercourses of Hungary and Russia, and also seen
further south in Asia and in Northern Africa.” M. Milne-Edwards,
however, has not quite determined the species,
for, on comparison with the bones of other recognized and
existing species, it appears to differ rather remarkably in
its greater length.</p>

<p>Enough has probably been said, however, to show the
interest which attaches to the discovery, and to suggest
further research.</p>

<p>With the pelican ends the long list of birds mentioned
in the works of Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCLUSION.</div>

<p>The reader who has had the patience or the curiosity
to follow us thus far will, doubtless, ere this have formed
a just estimate of Shakespeare’s qualifications as a naturalist,
and will have drawn the only conclusion which the
evidence justifies.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read all that Shakespeare has written
in connection with ornithology, without being struck with
the extraordinary knowledge which he has displayed for
the age in which he lived; and our admiration for him as
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_298" title="298"> </a><!--322.png-->
a poet must be increased tenfold on perceiving that the
beauteous thoughts, which he has clothed in such beauteous
language, were dictated by a pure love of nature, and by
a study of those great truths which appeal at once to the
heart and to reason, and which infuse into the soul of
the naturalist the true spirit of poetry.</p>

Amongst the entries in the Council Book of the Corporation of Stratford,
during the period that John Shakespeare, the Poet’s father, was a member of the
Municipal body (he filled the office of Chamberlain in 1573), the name occurs

Boaden adds: “Let it be remembered in aid of this inference that tradition
has invariably assigned to him, as an actor, characters in the decline of life, and
that one of his relatives is reported to have seen him in the part of old Adam,
the faithful follower of Orlando, in that enchanting pastoral comedy <i>As You

We have, unfortunately, no proof that Joseph Taylor, the player, ever
painted portraits. There was a contemporary, however, named John Taylor, who
was an artist, and it is possible that these two have been confounded.</p>

<p>Boaden refers the picture to Burbage, “who is known to have handled the
pencil.” Op. cit., p. 49.</p>

In the following passage from <i>The Tempest</i>, Shakespeare, <i>à propos</i> of fish, gives
one of many proofs of his knowledge of human nature. Trinculo comes upon the
strange form of Caliban lying flat on the sands:&mdash;“What have we here? A man,
or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish: a very ancient and fish-like
smell; a kind of, not of the newest, poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in
England now (as once I was), and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool
there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man:
any strange beast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to relieve a
lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian!”&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>, Act ii.

The author of “The Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle, 1496,” makes the
following quaint remarks on the superiority of “Fysshynge” over “Huntynge”:&mdash;“For
huntynge, as to myn entent, is too laboryous, for the hunter must alwaye
renne and followe his houndes: traueyllynge and swetynge full sore. He blowyth
tyll his lyppes blyster. And when he weenyth it be an hare, full oft it is an hegge
hogge. Thus he chasyth and wote not what.”</p>

From this ancient practice, too, is derived the phrase, “to eat humble pie,”
more correctly written “<i>umble pie</i>.” This was a venison pasty, made of the
umbles (heart, liver, and lungs), and always given to inferiors, and placed low
down on the table when the squire feasted publicly in the hall.</p>

<i>Brock</i> is the old name for badger, and we still find the word occurring in
many names of places, possibly thereby indicating localities where the badger was
formerly common. Of these may be mentioned, Brockhurst in Shropshire,
Brockenhurst in Kent, Brockenborough in Wiltshire, Brockford in Suffolk,
Brockhall in Northampton, Brockhampton in Oxford, Dorset, Gloucester, and
Herefordshire, Brockham Green in Surrey, Brockholes in Lancashire and Yorkshire,
Brock-le-bank in Cumberland, Brocklesby in Lincolnshire, Brockley in

“<i>Rere-mouse</i>” from the old English “<i>hrere-mus</i>,” literally a raw mouse. The
adjective “rere” is still used in Wiltshire for “raw.” The bat is also known as the
“rennie-mouse” or “reiny-mouse,” although Miss Gurney, in her “Glossary of
Norfolk Words,” gives “ranny” for the shrew-mouse. The old name of “flittermouse,”
“fluttermouse,” or “fliddermouse,” from the high German, “<i>fledermaus</i>,”
does not appear in Shakespeare’s works.</p>

The weapon of this name, the most important of small fire-arms, is said to
have borrowed its title from this the most useful of small hawks, in the same way
that other arms&mdash;as the falcon, falconet, and saker&mdash;have derived their names
from larger and more formidable birds of prey. Against this view it is asserted
that the musket was invented in the fifteenth century by the Muscovites, and owes
its name to its inventors. See Bescherelle, “Dict. Nat.,” and “The Target: a
Treatise upon the Art Military,” 1756.</p>

Not only does the nightingale sing by day, but she is by no means the only

“Lady-smocks” (<i>Cardamine pratensis</i>), a common meadow plant appearing

Botanists are not agreed as to the particular plant intended by “cuckoo-buds.”
Miller, in his “Gardener’s Dictionary,” says the flower here alluded to is the
<i>Ranunculus bulbosus</i>. One commentator on this passage has mistaken the <i>Lychnis
flos cuculi</i>, or “cuckoo-flower” for “cuckoo-buds.” Another writer says,
“cuckoo-flower” must be wrong, and believes “cowslip-buds” the true reading,
but this is clearly a mistake. Walley, the editor of Ben Jonson’s Works,
proposes to read “crocus-buds,” which is likewise incorrect. Sidney Beisley,
the author of “Shakespeare’s Garden,” thinks that Shakespeare referred
to the lesser celandine, or pilewort (<i>Ranunculus ficaria</i>), as this flower appears
early in Spring, and is in bloom at the same time as the other flowers named
in the song.</p>

One would suppose that such a foreign substance as a “swallow-stone” in

Curious, if true. Dr. Lebour does not say that he ever found such stones
himself, nor does he vouch for their having been found by others in the nests.
We have examined a great number of swallows’ nests without being able to
discover anything of the kind.</p>

Pliny makes mention of a “swallow-stone,” but says nothing about its being
found in the nest. On the contrary, he says it is found in the stomach of the
bird! “In ventre hirundinum pullus <i>lapilli</i> candido aut rubenti colore, qui
‘chelidonii’ vocantur, magicis narrati artibus reperiuntur.”</p>

<p>But we have adopted the above reading in preference for three reasons: 1. Considering
the rudimentary nature of the ostrich’s wing, Shakespeare would not have
been so incorrect as to describe them as “winging the wind;” 2. The word
“bated,” if intended to refer to eagles, and not to ostriches, would have been
more correctly “bating;” 3. The expression, “to bate with the wind,” is well
understood in the language of falconry, with which Shakespeare was familiar.</p>
